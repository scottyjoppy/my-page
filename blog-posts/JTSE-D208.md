Hello friends,

<br>

I've been thinking over the past few days and while yes I'm already in the mindset of making this parser and new blog creating page, I think I need to get the website functional before I spend forever on this new feature.

<br>

## What To Do Then?

<br>

The plan now is to put this markdown stuff on hold for a bit. Instead, I'll focus on adding what I need to to the database. As well as making any of the style updates I want. Ultimately, I just want to be able to merge these branches soon, and then once it's already styled and updated, I can slowly work on the blog portion of it. I mainly also just want to delete some of this legacy code that I just have here temporarily. Like old components, bootstrap stuff, tailwind...

<br>

I'm still working through this sickness I've had the past few days but today I felt well enough to do some programming. Hopefully I can keep getting some updates out and in a few days I'll have something functional out. Thanks for reading today's blog, until tomorrow!
