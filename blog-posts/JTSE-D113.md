Hello friends,

<br>

I'm really enjoying this informative series on developping a game from scratch in C++: **_[Game Dev in C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XsBqIXGEKY&list=PLs6oRBoE2-Q_fX_rzraQekRoL7Kr7s5xi)_**. And I made it a personal challenge to deal with the fact that they do everything in Visual Studio, while I'm using AND learning Vim. It can kinda feel like I'm shooting myself in the foot doing this but I believe I learn best when I'm thrust into the deep end of the pool and have to swim to survive.

## Stupid SFML

<br>

I spent all my time today troubleshooting how to download SFML. What is SFML? To my understanding it's a sort of library to create games, and more. It stands for _Simple_ and _Fast_ _Multimedia_ _Library_. It helps with things like managing the window, drawing, and system stuff. I'm not entirely certain on what it does, I just know the tutorial uses it so I'll try to get it working. 

<br>

My struggle in installing it comes from a variety of places. Inexperience in Vim, inexperience on the command line, different libraries and programs all with different dates, compatibility issues, patience, and LLM's often feeding me false information. After going in a loop twice with ChatGPT I had to call it for today. It is frustrating but I need to establish exactly what I want, and how, and make it work.

<br>

Today was a lesson in resilience. I know I can make it work, it'll just take time and willpower. Thank you for reading today's blog, may I bring to you better news tomorrow.
