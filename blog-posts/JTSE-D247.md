Hello friends,

<br>

Learning electronics is different from learning code.

<br>

Duh right.

<br>

## But Why?

<br>

The first blatant thing is that it's much riskier to just try things. I understand that I'll blow out a lot of components while I learn but it's really nerve wracking to always think that if I wire something wrong it could break. With code that was never an issue but with physical components I have the added headache of having to go out and actually order more parts.

<br>

There's just a lot to learn. I never really learned about electronics but I'm trying to do it from the basics. Namely I want to start with small things like logic gates before using these black box IC's that will handle this stuff for me. I think it's important to know what goes on under the hood. But it ain't easy to learn.

<br>

Again since I don't want to break anything I spent most of the time today on TinkerCAD prototyping what I actually wanted to create. But with so little knowledge and no clear way to learn I do feel quite lost. 

<br>

This isn't like coding where there's a plethora of new and up to date information on everything you could possibly do. And the added benefit of being able to paste error logs directly into an LLM. No for these circuits most videos are at least 6-8 years old, bad quality, and LLM's have actually been of quite little help.

<br>

I need to find a good resource to learn from, that or I just gotta be better at studying this stuff on my own. I do really want to learn this stuff and it excited me to no end to have so much learning ahead of me. I just gotta brace myself for the challenge, but we'll get there, friend.
