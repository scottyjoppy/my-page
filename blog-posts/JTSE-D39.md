Hello,

<br>

I have a lot of ideas. A lot of them are completely unachievable at the moment. I'm strict with myself to not view them as impossible, as I believe with enough determination, I can find a way. However, this issue has haunted me as I've learned to code. Additionally, as a bit of a perfectionist, I struggle to just hack away at a project fully aware that there is an optimal way I haven't learned. This is all to say today I tried to solve a problem but couldn't. Which leads me to reflect on the reasons why:

<br>

- Unclear Vision: When solving any task, it's vital to have some visualization of how it will work. The more accurate the better. When I wrote scripts, I would often start with the ending, giving me a clear path to construct the story. Without some vision of what you're doing, you dive fully into the unknown with no indication as to how to escape.
- Patience: I struggle with wanting to solve things immediately. Even if it leads to the right solution, I have trouble doing what may seem wrong in the moment. Moreover, I need to be able to take a second to stop, look back, and spend time reading and learning how to do it right. Reliance on AI is not good. It's akin to slamming my head on a brick wall when I keep re-prompting to the same unhelpful solution. Take the time, breathe, and if needed, do something else.
- Plan On Paper: This is a skill I desperately need to adopt as a programmer. It basically helps both other issues as it forces me to visualize, and patiently plan my solution. It's such a raw form of planning that I genuinely believe won't go away, as its utility will always be essential.

<br>

Suffice it to say, I didn't move ahead much due to my getting stuck. However, with a good night's sleep and some reflection, I will face this issue again. See you tomorrow.
