Hello friends,

<br>

It's come to my attention that there are other options available to me when it comes to routing my web app. I've been looking back into the whole auth thing with regards to Supabase recently, preparing myself mentally to implement something like that. While I somewhat understand how to implement that, what still troubles me is this whole thing about protected routes. I'm now suffering the result of me not taking the time to learn while vibe coding because looking back at that code I have no earthly idea what's going on. But in my search for possible solutions I came across the React Router.

## React Router

First looking into it I wasn't a fan. It just seemed a bit overwhelming and I wasn't too sure how practical it would really be. After thinking about it more however, I could see a glimmer of potential. It's very similar to how Vue operates the routing, but React Router essentially provides a plethora of hooks and functions that allow you to create and control routing throughout your website. I think with a bit of effort I will be able to figure this thing out. And I think in the end, this will make the whole protected route thing much simpler; as well as being well worth my time to learn and implement in the website. Yeah I'll have to remodel some things but short of rewriting this whole website in Vue, this is a decent alternative.

Today was mainly a research day, with some time also spent contemplating my next steps forward. I've been feeling quite lost the past week but hopefully over the holidays I have some time to think. Thanks for reading today's blog, until next time.
