Hello friends,

<br>

[Tinker Cad](https://www.tinkercad.com) is a website that allows you to simulate breadboard designs online. While it's great for it's extensive supply of components and detail, it's also nice to view other people designs. I spent most of today tinkering around and seeing how things work. As well as trying to identify some common patterns throughout the designs. 

<br>

I think I've watched enough videos to understand the general purpose and use of a breadboard, but there's a lot I need to get more comfortable with. Namely understanding the difference between current, voltage and resistance. And how they all play in how you setup your components and make them interact. Ohm's law will be my friend.

<br>

One of the first things I want to go over are the different gate variants. I think this low level learning is a good chance for me to understand how things like computers really work under all the layers of abstraction. And without overwhelming myself I think it could be good to try and learn these things.

<br>

All in all I'm hyped to get my kit, the start of a new era.
