Hello friends,

<br>

Looking it my kit of components I saw something called a servo. A small actuator that can turn to a precise degree.

<br>

## The Applications

<br>

Servos are an essential part of robotics. I mainly got interested in them after looking through some of the common components found in many of these robot kits online. As well as it's reoccurrence in YouTube videos.

<br>

I made a small circuit using a potentiometer to move the servo left and right. Once I got that working I thought it would be cool to control it with the remote. This was the first time with this electronics stuff where I had an idea, as well as enough knowledge to execute on it. After a bit of coding (brushing up on my C++) and debugging I got this to work.

I was really happy to see this working and while it is still a very small step, I'm hoping it will lead to bigger things in the future. Until next time, friend.
