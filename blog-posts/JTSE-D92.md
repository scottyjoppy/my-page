Hello friends,

<br>

While I doubt I have such eager readers to tell, I have been slacking when it comes to writing the blog. It has not been easy to stay on top of this commitment and I have unfortunately, fallen off the horse. It used to be that I would write a bit or all of the blog during the day so that in the evening I could just post it and do some coding, but recently I have not been coding much or writing. I put off the blog for days at a time, and am then forced to back track and write them a few days late. I'll always do my best to ensure that there is a blog up to cover all the days until I achieve my goal, but I also need to be more focused on getting them completed on time. It's a commitment to myself and to you the reader to continue this blog until I achieve my goal. So, in hopes of sharing some honesty, I write today's blog and share how things have been recently. Thank you for your understanding, and I'll see you tomorrow, friend.
