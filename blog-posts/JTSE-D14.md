Hello,

<br>

I’m now two weeks into my daily blog and I thought today I’d write a small reflection on my experience. I feel a bit silly talking about two weeks, knowing full well this could be a year or multiple year journey. Nonetheless, here is my experience so far.

<br>

## Reflection

<br>

Consistency wins over motivation every day. I do think motivation is important to keep strong and I do so through meetups, and podcasts. Stories of people from all walks of life entering tech inspire me. But consistency gets you through the days when motivation is weighed down by life.

<br>

The past few weeks have been very web development focused. My logic is that my background in film, editing, and experience with design in Photoshop and Illustrator, is best translated to web design. So I see it as the best chance to break into tech.

<br>

I've been staying up late writing these blogs every night but I think it's best if I start delaying them one day. That way I can start my evening writing about the day before and won't have to worry about going late into the night writing.

<br>

It's been a lovely two weeks and writing the little progress I make every day has helped put into perspective the work I'm putting in. I'm aware my blog writing isn't up to par as of yet but I hope with time these get better. The CSS position day was good in the sense that I had to research more thoroughly before writing and I think that's a good thing. Teaching is a great way to solidify your understanding, which is partly why I'm doing this.

<br>

But all in all it's been great, I thank you for reading and will see you the next day.

<br>
<br>
