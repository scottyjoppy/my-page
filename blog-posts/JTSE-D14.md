Hello,

<br>

I’m now two weeks into my daily blog and I thought today I’d write a small reflection of my experience. I feel a bit silly talking about 2 weeks knowing full well this could be a year or multiple year journey. Nonetheless, here has been my experience so far.

<br>

## Reflection

<br>

Consistency wins over motivation everyday. I do think motivation is important to keep strong and I do so through the meetups, and the podcasts. Stories of people from all walks of life entering tech is very inspiring. But consistency gets you through the days when motivation is weighed down by life. 

<br>

The past few weeks have been very web development focused. My logic is that my background in film, editing, and experience with design in Photoshop and Illustrator, are best translated to web design. So I see it as the best chance to get work. 

<br>

Thank you for your time, time is precious and if you were here spending some of yours, I thank you, dearly.

<br>
<br>
