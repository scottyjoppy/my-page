Hello friends,

<br>

So now that I'm done I think I need some time to rest. What I really mean by that is I'm not gonna get right back into game development just yet. So for now, I'm gonna stay in a web dev mindset.

<br>

## Why? Isn't that just procrastinating again?

<br>

Well, yeah it kinda is. But in this time I'm awaiting a reply from the company and hopefully I'll be given a chance to interview and discuss the project. If that time does come around they've warned us that they would ask questions about the project to confirm our understanding of our own code. So for that reason I think it's wise to continue doing some web development in the meantime. But what could I possibly do??

<br>

## Next On The Agenda

<br>

This website was made for the sole purpose of providing a platform for me to write blogs. Besides a small stint in the summer where I went wild with SVG's and isometry, I haven't made any concrete changes or updates to this website. I think it's time I changed that. I've been keeping a small list of changes I would like to make. I've actually gathered a lot of these ideas from things I've seen on other people blogs on HackerNews. So after inspecting how they go about it, as well as some ideas I've created on my own, I think it's time to finally upgrade this website a bit. Also gives me a chance to show some improvement from me as a developer.

<br>

That's gonna be my task until I hopefully get an interview with Sport Radar. Thank you for reading today's blog, and expect some changes coming soon to this website! Until then, friend.
