Hello friends,

<br>

Despite my ambitions to grow and learn in this field, my current job still demands a lot from me. In this summer season there is a lot to do and I'm starting work earlier and finishing later most days, with much less time in between to research and read online. It's quite unfortunate but I'm trying my best to stay focused and push forward. I will continue to write about my days and document the full, realistic journey to a software engineer. Thank you, until tomorrow, friend.
