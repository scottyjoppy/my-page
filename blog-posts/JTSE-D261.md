Hello friends,

<br>

In it's current state I feel as if I'm forcing a blog out when I should really be saving my energy on potentially making one good blog instead of several meh ones. So here's what I'm thinking.

<br>

## The Plan

<br>

I think this forceful ***You Must Make a Blog Everyday*** is really getting to me. I keep procrastinating and then pumping out five or more mediocre blogs, at a time when I barely remember what I did during the first few. I feel that removes from the authenticity and joy of writing on the internet. I don't want this to feel like a chore, but more so a story of my personal journey into the tech field. 

<br>

I need a change.

<br>

I want to allow myself to skip days, not the title days but the calendar days. If I don't code or work for a few due to laziness, sickness, vacation... I don't want to waste posting a day writing the simple line *"I didn't do nothin'."*. I want instead to write when I have things to write about. If I've been working on something for a few days, then bunch that into one full blog. One that includes the intro, work, and conclusion of that task.

<br>

There's no need for me to separate one event into multiple stupid *cliff-hanger* blogs when it should really just be one concise thing. Additionally, I don't need to justify to my non existent audience why I didn't post for a day. Even less through a lame *no code day* blog. That's just a waste of a day. This series should recount all the active days of progression towards my goal.

<br>

From now on, I'll hold myself to exactly that.
