Hello friends,

<br>

The past few days have not involved much coding unfortunately. On the bright side I'm surprised it took this long into my holiday to have some days without any coding. But I'm glad I made it this far. I'll be back to normal progress tomorrow, but for these two days, I'll take a small break. Thank you for joining, until tomorrow.
