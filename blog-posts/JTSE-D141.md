Hello friends,

<br>

Today I created the points class.

<br>

## Points

<br>

Simply put I needed a way of giving the user some dopamine when killing an enemy. I created a similar file to framerate and just changed some of the variables. One thing that is a bit of a struggle with SFML is writing text. That's just the kind of trade-off you have when working low-level but you have to be very explicit with everything. The SFML docs have been very useful in defining the different methods you can call, types that are produced or required, and how different classes intertwine.

<br>

Apart from points today I also did some small things, like reduce enemy health to 10 so they get one shot by the player. I also changed the size of the map and scale of the tiles.

<br>

The game is coming along well and I'm surprised at how well I'm able to figure things out on my own. I was worried going away from the tutorial series but I'm glad to say things are going well and I should be wrapping up this game in no time. Thank you for reading today's blog, until tomorrow, friend.
