Hello friends,

<br>

Past few days I've been racking my brain trying to think of all the things I'm gonna need when it comes to robotics. The main issue I keep coming back to is, I need *stuff*. Just everything, chassis, metal, wires, motors... The list goes on and on and on. And while my ideas only get wilder my budget is still super constrained. I don't want to blow a bunch of money on crap while I'm learning this so I want to be smart about this.

<br>

## The Plan

<br>

After searching on Reddit, I came across a few comments saying that the best way they found a lot of these parts is from used printers. That's when it hit me, there's a whole cabal of people just giving stuff away for free on the internet. After a quick look, there it was, like a hundred printers in my city that people are just getting rid of. 

<br>

This is great for two reasons. The first and most obvious, parts, lots of me'. Motors, wires, screws, springs you name it. And second of all, I learn mainly by taking things apart, stripping them to their core and then putting it back together. Digging into peoples unwanted electronics will be a great lesson in how most electronics are wired, the classic components that go into these various gadgets. All without the fear of breaking something, since it was all free and going in the trash anyways. If anything fixing something would be fantastic, I could experiment to no end.

<br>

Honestly I'm really excited to get my hands on some unwanted tech. To just tear it apart and dig up all the valuables inside. Maybe I'll just end up with an apartment full of garbage but hopefully through all of that, some treasures too.
