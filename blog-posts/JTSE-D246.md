Hello friends,

<br>

It finally arrived!

<br>

I'm so excited to start learning all this electronics stuff. After days of learning some of the basics online I can finally actually work with some physical components. Exciting.

<br>

So what did I get?

<br>

- [Arduino Kit](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CGJ235XN?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [Wire Cutters](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0CHHKN1WM?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [Soldering Station](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0D636SLHG?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [Rubber Mat](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0G24Z971W?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)

<br>

The bulk of the haul comes from the Arduino kit, it's got a bunch of things for me to play with. The main being the Arduino Uno R4 Minima. It seemed to cover all the bases the cool thing being the wheels, I really want to make something that moves.

<br>

## What Did I Do First

<br>

Well the first thing was to ooh and awe at all the stuff I now have. But the second was to try and make the LED's light up.

<br>

Wait wait wait... I skipped some steps. While yes I first got things to work with just the battery and an LED, I was also interested in how the Arduino works.

<br>

There was a tutorial link in the package that led me to a page outline basically everything in the kit. There was also a helpful tutorial on how to setup the Arduino. Namely installing the Arduino IDE, a quick rundown of the libraries to install, and some example code- like this blinking light code.

<br>

Once I got that all setup I wanted to test some of the other modules that were included. So I searched up some designs on TinkerCAD and created this timer with the 7-segment display module.

I still have a lot to learn but it was really fun finally getting to mess around with all this stuff. The future is looking bright, excited to share what I work on next!
