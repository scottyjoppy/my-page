Hello friends,

<br>

Today I came to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't continue following the series on C++ and SFML Game Development. Not because I don't want to, but because the tutorials end in only two episodes. 

<br>

## The Series

<br>

Huge shoutout to ***[Mustafa Sibai](https://www.youtube.com/@MustafaSibaiDev)*** and his amazing series on C++ & SFML. I've learned a ton throughout and I'm happy to have watched the series this far. It only feels like we're a quarter of the way through the project so I feel a bit stranded since the videos end soon. So in a fit of urgency I decided I should start going on my own.

<br>

## Space Invaders

<br>

Making an RPG is a big task. It will take me many months and it won't be good. I think I'm better off making multiple small projects, getting a feel for game development with these technologies, and then come back to make the RPG. So which games should I make? Simple ones. Space Invaders came to mind and that will be my current endeavor. So I forked the RPG project and started modifying it.

<br>

It was fun to start something on my own. To actually have to think instead of just follow a tutorial. And now I'll just try to implement as much of the lessons and standards that Mustafa set in the tutorial. That is all for today, I hope to provide some footage of the game soon! Until next time, friend.
