description: "The struggles of sorting cards"
---

Hello friends,

<br>

Today was rather unfortunate. I struggled the entire evening without actually coming to a solution. So here's what happened.

<br>

## The Issue

<br>

The overall issue was a lack in motivation to get me through the code. Some days are just like that, and like it or not I try to push forward and do something. The problem I wanted to solve is sorting the cards. Currently every plant has a sort number. When I create the gallery page I keep them in order depending on the database. The issue arose when I opened up the database and saw my sort numbers all over the place. I wanted the sort order to normalize from 1, and grant the user the ability to move plants up or down in the gallery.

<br>

Problems arose, like how plant sort numbers would be shared between users, causing one user to have plants 1-3, and user two start from 4 onwards. I found myself overwhelmed with a few things: Supabase functions, API calls using Next.js routes.ts, and general organization in my folder structure. Once again I found myself lost in a sea of outdated and contradicting information and I had no idea what I needed to get this to work. This all ended up in me having to call the evening early, sad.

<br>

## Aftermath

<br>

So lesson learned, I need to do some research. I do like the approach of just jumping into things blind and seeing if I can swim, but sometimes this happens too. Where I crash bad and need to just start fresh. Tomorrow I'll look into the docs and try to understand how I can go about solving this. Taking a step back to fully view the problem and determine my options. I'm sorry I haven't much else to offer in today's blog, but if anything it's an insight into the reality of learning to code, of committing and showing up everyday despite motivation, despite time constraints, just showing up. Thank you for keeping up with the day's blog. I'll see you on the other side, friend.
