Hello,

<br>

Today was pretty packed. That meant, in terms of coding, I had little time to do anything. I also didn't have much time to learn anything new. But that's okay. I don't regret spending one day doing other things. It's about consistency and not letting one day off coding spiral into weeks. It's about the long term commitment to keep at it, keep learning, and keep getting back on the horse. Tech is my future and the future of the world. I'm fascinated by it all and want to explore it fully and understand as much of it as possible. Today may not have been a step toward the goal but it's by no means the final step. Today's blog will be short, but I'm excited to get back to it and share what comes next.  
Thank you for reading this short self-reflection. I'll see y'all tomorrow.
