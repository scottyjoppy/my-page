Hello friends,

<br>

Today I'm on a plane embarking on a trip to Canada for a few weeks so finding time to code will be a bit tougher. I'll do my best to keep learning and developping my skills while I'm away but don't be alarmed if I'm a bit slower in getting these out. All that aside, today I had the chance to experiment with Vim and C++ a bit more.

<br>

## Pyramid Project

<br>

One of the first assignments I had in the CS50 course was to create a pyramid. To utilize loops and console logs to produce a pyramid that could be extended up and down. Armed with a bit of knowledge of Vim, and the basics of C++, I did just that. I started with creating a basic left leaning upside down pyramid. To flipping it upright. To adding spaces to make it an actual pyramid. I learned a lot doing this and had some good practice using Vim. It's a bit of a struggle but I can feel in my soul that I'm gonna enjoy it quite a bit.

<br>

That's all I got for today, I'll be keeping these blogs fairly short on my trip but I hope to still put out a blog a day during. Thanks for reading, happy learning, friends.
