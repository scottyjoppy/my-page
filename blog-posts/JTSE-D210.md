Hello friends,

<br>

Well I didn't make the cut. I'm pretty bummed about it especially since I need to rethink my whole strategy for at least another year. In many ways it was just too good to be true but I don't want to dwell too much on it. So I'll give it just one sad blog.

<br>

For those that aren't aware, I worked on this calendar project a few weeks ago as an application for this academy type program that would offer proffessional training and experience in a tech forward coding environment. It was basically everything I've been searching for since I before I started this blog. But yesterday I got the unfortunate news that I didn't make it. While I'm not sure why they ultimately decided to cut me, or if I ever was a top contender, I do hope I can get some clear answers in the next few days. I'm trying to just tell myself maybe there's a reason, or that something better will come. But in the moment it's a bit hard to see forward. So much of my future plans in the past months have been hinged on getting into this program but now that I'm denied, I'm feeling pretty lost. I can't help but imagine all the things I must've done wrong but it bugs me most to receive a feedback email which is 14 things I've done right, and 3 I could've done *better*. I'm sure I'm just taking things too personally but I can't help that this all just really saddens me. I just poured so much of myself into this that I hate to see it fall flat. But I can't be sad about it forever. I have to pick myself up and just get back on the horse. Not really much else I can do.
