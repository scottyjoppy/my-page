Hello friends,

<br>

I hit my rhythm today. Got two more pages mobile ready! I'll keep this one short so I can get back to *responsive designing* but today I made some good progress.

<br>

When I had to do this for the Sport Radar project I did it within a few hours. The reason this page is taking longer is just that things are more complicated. I need to make more design choices when adapting the page for mobile. For example you can make your page knowing well that everything will already be centered and ready for mobile. Or you can responsively change the layout for all types of devices.

<br>

I prefer the latter as you can create unique experiences for people depending on the mode of viewing. For example on the projects page, if you are on a computer you can hover over the technologies and see the names of them. On mobile that setting is disabled as there just isn't enough space. On the other hand on the main page you can see the borders of the Ascii art only if you zoom completely out. So there's a little surprise for everyone.

<br>

Either way just got one more page to go before I got to figure out how to merge in the feature branch, hopefully that doesn't take too long.
