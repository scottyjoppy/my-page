Hello friends,

<br>

It's funny to look back sometimes and think how I just spent so much time getting the simplest thing to work. This SFML library has been a huge pain in my butt for the past few days but today I got it working. My reward, a black window with a circle in it. Yay.

<br>

## Why?

<br>

Why do this in the first place. Firstly the SFML library is the first stepping stone in developing some simple 2D games. Once I can get a window up, then draw an object on it, it's a few long steps and then I have a game! It's an important part of the YouTube series to get this working and I'm glad that I could get it figured just me and Claude. I also got a bit more accustomed to working with Vim.

<br>

## Vim

<br>

The way I'm learning Vim is by just doing what I need to do, and every so often searching how I can do something better. Say I get tired of shift arrow clicking to get to the end of a line, just press Shift-A. Want to add an empty line above or below, capital or lowercase O. I'll continue to learn these shortcuts until I'm just flying through programming in Vim. I also think it's best not to overload my head with shortcuts and instead just take things one normal sized bite at a time.

<br>

That's all I got for today's update, I hope in the next few days I can continue following through this series and start making something substantial. Thank you for reading today's blog. A small improvement, consistently over a long period of time, will change your life forever, friend.
