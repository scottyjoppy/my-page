Hello friends,

<br>

The past three days can be summed up as creating and integrating a bunch of Ascii art. The most useful tool I found is this [Image To Ascii](https://www.asciiart.eu/image-to-ascii) converter that allows me to dial in the details of an image.

<br>

## Creation

<br>

There's four main types of Ascii I'm bringing in, image borders, dividers, background patterns, and images. Most of the time I'll create a new component and absolutely position it where I want. But other times I make use of ::before and ::after to create simple patterns or dividers. 

<br>

It's important to consider font size when making Ascii art. While I like things being pixel perfect, I really need to focus in the testing to make sure my site works across all devices. First I want it to work on my screen but ultimately it should work on all. I know that using view height and width dimensions will be a problem in the future so I'm making a mental note of whenever that crutch was used.

<br>

## The Fun Of It

<br>

Despite the learning curve of adding text as art, I'm really enjoying the process. Feels like I'm breathing life into this otherwise bootstrapped and simplistic website. Making it interesting, putting more *me* in there so to say. The images, the quotes, it's nice to express yourself.

<br>

All the while I enjoy perusing other blogs and extracting what I fancy. [Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) has helped that search by providing a fast fun way to loop at random pages.

<br>

All in all this has been good fun but I'm starting to fear I've once again pushed the end of this site update quite some time...
