Hello friends,

<br>

Today's blog will be nice and short, I didn't code today. For two main reasons. The first being that I simply did not have time between work and life to sit down at my laptop and think long and hard. The other reason being that yesterday burned me out so hard that I have no interest in continuing today, tomorrow I will get back into it but I need to just take a day to breathe. See ya tomorrow friends.
