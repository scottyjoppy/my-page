Hello,

<br>

I write this blog in the hopes that one day I can look back and see it was all worth it. And I really do hope that one day I can pay it forward, help other people who are in the situation I am now work towards a future they are proud of. It's a grind, and it will stay that way for a while. But I'm ready, I'm determined, and I'm certain it will pay off. Today I thought I'd write about what a typical day for me looks like. And hopefully in a few years I can compare my progress, struggles, and discipline.

<br>

## 4:00AM

<br>

I'm more of a morning person. Even though I struggle to wake up every day, but something about it is so peaceful. But I'd be lying to myself if I said most days started at 4:00. Today like most days, I snoozed until 4:30. I meal prep burritos for the week so all I gotta do is throw them in the toaster and wait 20 minutes. Meanwhile I just slowly start to wake up. Today I cleaned the dishes, listened to some calm instrumental soundtracks, then sat and stared at the wall for a few minutes. Peaceful.

<br>

## 6:00AM

<br>

I leave the house at around 5 and get to work just before 6. On the way I either do something productive like research what I'll code in the evening. For example today I knew I wanted to learn about customising Tailwind color themes, as well as how parallax and scroll effects are created.  
I also use this time to decide what podcasts I'll be listening to for the next 10 hours. Today I started the first few episodes of **_[Syntax](https://syntax.fm)_**.

<br>

## 10:00AM

<br>

At around this time things have slowed down at work. I take this opportunity to first and foremost grab a coffee. Then with any time I have I save new job opportunities. I mainly search **_[LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com)_** and **_[Devjobs](https://en.devjobs.at)_** a great site for the Austrian tech job market. If I have more time (not today) I'll also see if I can do any editing on my GitHub app. Naturally I can't do anything big but for example I changed a couple classes to fix a CSS grid issue I had. Otherwise I'll make note of any edits I can do in the evening.

<br>

## 2:00PM

<br>

Lunch time is a good time for some more focused learning. I'll usually sit down and watch one or a few videos once again pertaining to my current tasks for the day. Today I watched a tutorial by **_[Kevin Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmzFk68Bwdk&t=292s)_** an amazing CSS teacher who I can't recommend enough.

<br>

## 4:00PM

<br>

Quittin' time! If I can I'll get out earlier but my trip home is not so interesting. I usually try to wind down a bit and do some mindless stuff, like play **_[Polytopia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/874390/The_Battle_of_Polytopia/)_**.

<br>

## 5:00

<br>

I'm lucky I get to come home to such an amazing wife and really enjoy spending some time just chatting about our day. Relationships are most important, and it's a great way to unwind and disconnect from tech for a bit.  
Afterwards I start my coding for the evening. Today I tried some CSS art. Trying to recreate some of what's on the reference Momence website. I updated and extended some of the Tailwind themes with my own color scheme. On a side note, Co-Pilot was very useful here. Generating many repetitive classes in similar shades of a color can be such a bore, but it really sped up the process to 'Vibe Code' that section.

<br>

## 8:00PM

<br>

I kept coding until dinner time. And the rest of the evening can be summed up with eating, a bit of co-op gaming, more coding, then writing this blog.

<br>

## 11:30PM

<br>

I wish I could get more sleep, and I'm sure I could benefit from it. But until I either get better with my schedule or code a bit less I'm not sure when that will happen sadly.  
But we push on, and I should probably end this here, got early rise tomorrow, and the next day...

<br>
<br>

Thank you once again for your time, never give up, strive for the best.
