Hello friends,

<br>

Yeah unfortunately I didn't have much time to code today. While I couldn't code I did get some ideas when it comes to refactoring this website a bit. As well of what I want my next project to be. I'm expecting to need to brush up on some web development stuff coming up soon so I am considering to try out Vue.js. I've heard a lot of good about it but haven't had the opportunity to employ it in one of my projects, but I think now's the time. As for database I'll either stick with supabase or try another one out, but either way that's all "post" making this game. I'll be back tomorrow, until then friend.
