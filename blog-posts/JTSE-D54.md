Hello,

<br>

I'm proud to announce I've gotten my first FreeCodeCamp certification, for responsive web design. Looking at the history of this course, I began September 14, 2024, but went my own way until returning May 19, 2025. Feels a bit silly getting this certification now after having deployed a few websites but I'm glad to have something concrete to show my education in the field.

<br>

I'll be keeping today's blog rather short as besides having completed the certification I haven't made much progress elsewhere today. Sleep has been troubling for me all week and today I finally gave in going from 5 hours to a whopping 13 hour sleep. Weekends are great to recuperate but I hope in the future to build a better relation with sleep. So final note, sleep is important, get some when you can, I know I try. But thanks for reading this quick update, I'll see ya tomorrow.
