Hello friends,

<br>

Toady I made some aliens.

<br>

## Aseprite

<br>

***[Aseprite]*(https://www.aseprite.org)** is a very cute and well-made sprite/pixel editing tool. I downloaded some sprites to use for the aliens but they were all in their own image file. Rather than have to load 12 alien images, I wanted to combine them into one sheet. Now I might just be done, but I couldn't get the precision or simplicity I wanted from both Photoshop and Illustrator, and in a hope to one day be free from the Adobe overlords, I decided to try something new. Aseprite came to the rescue and made it super easy for me to combine them at pixel perfect quality. There are many other features I'll have to explore in the future but for today, Aseprite rocks.

## LevelLoader

<br>

I then had to actually load the file which wasn't too complicated. I could keep most of the existing logic which was nice. When I was moving some variables and functions around however I'm happy to say I used & and * with little errors! Since being introduced to these it's been a hard process to learn how to use them and not leak memory. But I'm getting to a point where even my vague understanding of them is enough to use it in production. Yay, new milestone as a programmer!

<br>

That is all for today's blog, thank y'all for tuning in an I hope to provide more updates tomorrow. Until then, friend.
