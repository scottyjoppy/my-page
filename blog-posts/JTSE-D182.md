Hello friends,

<br>

As a quick reminder this blog was created with the sole purpose of documenting my full journey from working in a warehouse to my ideal Software Engineer position. I've been determined to achieve that goal for quite some time and that determination hasn't faded. As of recently I've been given a first opportunity to take a step towards that goal. It's a coding academy that specializes in web development. I'm thrilled about the opportunity and hope I can prove myself during the interview portion of the application. This is the first time in the 13 months now of programming that I've been presented an opportunity to work in this type of field. I will do whatever I can to not waste it.

<br>

My goals are long term, and software engineer is but the first step in a career where tech and programming are center. I know in my heart that I just need to get my foot in the door, once I can do that, I'll at least be on the right path. I'll be it just at the starting line, but on the right track. I'm excited, truly. Maybe one day these blogs will amount to something. But I thank anyone that has taken a moment to even skim the title of my blogs. We'll all make it one day, friend.
