Hello friends,

<br>

I'm due to spend a day not hyper fixated on code. Today wasn't a conscious choice to do so, but a well appreciated one. I always feel odd doing something just for fun, like go to the beach. I'm always so worried about maximizing every second of the day, that it's easy to forget the fun life has to offer. Days like today are a good reminder that life is good, and it's perfectly okay to spend some time enjoying it. It's okay to be ambitious and set goals, but it's also okay to take a step back now and again. Otherwise it's a straight path to burnout.

<br>

If you've read until here, thanks. I feel if anything I'm just writing to myself years from now but if there are any other genuine humans reading any part of this blog series, thanks, there will be more to come. May we make our acquaintance soon again, in a new light, in a new time, friend.
