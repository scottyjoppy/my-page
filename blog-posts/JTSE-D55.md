Hello,

<br>

Did a bit more work on the isometric map's design today and thought I'd share some more pictures of the progress. As a reminder, last time I wasn't fully set on color, had only created a few modal buildings, and was just getting started in terms of paths and roads.

<br>

So first off, the landscape once more. Not much has changed here besides of course the color. I will be adding some variety in the water, as well as some depth with the islands, to make it more interesting.

Next up the roads. I've now fully roaded-out island West but I'm still wondering if perhaps my canvas should extend to complete each island. But for the moment I'm happy with this size.

Finally the buildings. I'm still far from done in terms of the actual building filling the map but I'm happy with how it's turning out so far. You may notice the lines going through the billboard which are actually there for a purpose. I'm currently using them as paths to write text on dynamically in code. They are not slanted because the isometric look only really works if I do that in code not in Figma.

Overall I'm happy with the progress so far and I'm stocked to see this piece come to life. I'm not as far ahead as I'd like to be, but good things take time. Thanks for reading today's blog, I'll see you again tomorrow.
