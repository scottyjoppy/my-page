Hello friends,

<br>

Today I spent some time in Aseprite making extra textures for the cube.

<br>

## Making Textures

<br>

I looked at a couple online isometric references to estimate the dimensions I would need for the top tile I already have. Looking back on it now I should've spent more time diligently measuring what I would need because I ended up being wrong multiple times.

<br>

It was quite tragic, I immediately had some scaling issues when I brought the texture into the project. I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why it was just slightly off until I revisited Aseprite and saw that I was just a bit off. Repeat this mistake another time and that was pretty much my day, just a lot of frustration with textures.

<br>

I unfortunately didn't do much else today since these issues took up a lot of my time. But at least I figured it out eventually. Thank you for reading my blog today, see ya tomorrow.
