Hello,

<br>

Starting this project I was mainly worried about animation. When looking through the **_[Momence](https://momence.com)_** I was confident I could figure out how to format the page, organize a fitting color theme, create similar looking UI elements - but I don't have much experience with animation. Well, today I learned a bit of animation. It wasn't anything crazy but I watched Tom Is Loading's **_[Smooth Scrolling Parallax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5NK61vO_sg)_**. I was introduced to the animation library, **_[Framer Motion](https://motion.dev)_** and smooth scroll library **_[Lenis](https://motion.dev)_**. Both such powerful tools that made this daunting task of smoothly animating my website much easier. I haven't had much time to experiment with it today but I will be sure to continue using it as I develop this site.

## Podcast selections

<br>

I vary through a few different podcasts throughout my days. The past few have been all the **_[Syntax](https://syntax.fm)_** podcast, but today I thought I'd get back to some other voices. I really enjoy hearing Quincy Larson from **_[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/podcast/)_** interview devs from all walks of life. He makes a huge effort to keep the interviews inclusive of all levels of software engineer, and is ever-so engaging just spewing out excitement over coding. His guests really help inspire me every day, by reminding me that the path to software engineer is different for everybody. Sure some follow the straight path through college or university but many many devs come from completely different fields. Many are self-taught, seeking to better their lives and switch into the tech industry. A story I write for myself every day.

<br>

## Some background

<br>

For fun I'll sprinkle some of my background throughout these blogs but as stated on day 1, coding is very new to me. I'm a creative at heart. I studied film production and all the while pursued a personal hobby of playing and writing music. I love music, I love film too, and I don't regret getting a degree in that field one bit. You never know where life will lead and I'm sure that I can pull from those experiences one day. My piano stares back at me every single day and my burning desire to play never really subsides. I just know that now, I need to code, I need to code a lot. I need to learn as much as I possibly can every single day and work towards my most urgent goal of getting out of labour jobs. Ideally move to a software engineering job but anything that doesn't require 20k steps a day is an upgrade.

<br>

Workdays don't leave much room for coding unfortunately. It's just how it is and I'm fine with that. But some is always better than none, and I'll do my best everyday to make that some as effective as possible. To hopefully, learn something new, every day, however small.

<br>

Thank you for joining me on the end of week 1 of the Journey To: Software Engineer blog. Until next time (tomorrow).
