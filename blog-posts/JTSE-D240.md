Hello friends,

<br>

Today is the long awaited day. The release of the site I've been updating for a few months. Finally.

<br>

## Merging Is Terrifying

<br>

I am not at all comfortable with git merges. From the initial rebase command I felt like my stomach was in my mouth. Just fixing conflicts and working both in the terminal and with my VSCode extension that handles a lot of Git stuff. I just constantly felt like I was messing things up and was just terrified of loosing all the progress. After much debugging, I pulled through. Now the site is back having just one clean branch. I also took the liberty of removing some unscary files, imports, and folders throughout. 

<br>

## Taking Inventory

<br>

So where am I at now? Where to next? All questions that have been semi on the backburner for some time now. I think however, since it's been just been constantly on my mind, it's time, time to start robotics. I'm debating starting a new series but also I really just want to see this series actually reach fruition. I'll mull it over and if tomorrow shows day one you know what happened.

<br>

Regardless I'm gonna get into robotics. It's what I want to be doing in the end and there's no better time to start but now. Already having a peruse down this rabbit hole has made me both excited and terrified to enter this world...but mainly excited. Here we go, and enjoy the new site in the meantime, friend.
