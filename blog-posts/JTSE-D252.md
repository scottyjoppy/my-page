Hello friends,

<br>

There's been a slow down in any type of learning and blogging in the past week. I decided to take a full break here during my holiday with my wife and it was really nice. I'm always thinking so much and occupied with these things I've been teaching myself that I really haven't spent much time just to relax.

<br>

That is until the last day of the vacation when I got sick up till today where I'm still not feeling too great unfortunately. But I do plan on getting back into things soon. Once my head stops hurting.
