Hello,

<br>

When I started this blog series, I made one post about my daily schedule. Mainly, I did so to review it later on and compare. Well going on day 52 of this blog series I’ll share my current day to day.

<br>

## 4:30 - 6:00

<br>

My day starts somewhere between 4:30 and 5. Waking up is a challenge every morning. I usually get 5.5 to 6 hours of sleep which has been borderline enough to survive, but I definitely feel tired all day. It’s not ideal but it’s my reality. Mornings, on the other hand, are relatively relaxed just focusing on getting some food and being awake enough before leaving the house. On my way to work I usually think or start writing the blog for the previous day. Since starting this challenge I’ve changed from writing the blog on the same day late at night, to the next day. This way I can spend more time thinking about what I’m writing and am not hindered by exhaustion writing deep into the night. Besides blog stuff, I try to consume something educational, read some articles, docs, or anything of interest related to tech.

<br>

## 6:00 - 16:00

<br>

Worktime. It’s always dependent on how busy the day is, but I try my best to at the very least work on the blog over the course of my shift. I also find it’s a good time to scroll through job ads and star a bunch for me to apply to on the weekend.

<br>

I hate hurry up and wait jobs. Or just being stuck with nothing to do. I leave early most days; not to avoid work but because I can’t stand just waiting for the clock to hit 16:00. I’m under the belief you should work until your work is done, not until your time is up. That’s why I also don’t have much of a problem with overtime. Of course I would rather not, especially when it’s not my dream job, but if I must I must.

<br>

Over my lunch break I still try to consume some educational content, ideally something related to the coding I’ll be doing in the evening. Today, I looked into Visual Basics as it's peaked my interest.

<br>

## 16:00 - 22/23:00 (or more)

<br>

Once home it’s a split between spending time with my lovely wife, and various coding endeavours. Today I did some FreeCodeCamp challenges to warm up, then dove right into some design work in Figma. My goal today was to start outlining the roads in my map. I used to play a lot of ***[City Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/)***, so drawing these roads was a bit reminiscent of that time. I made some clouds, adjusted some colors, and cleaned up my layers a bit.

<br>

It can sometimes feel like I’m burning the candle at both ends. At this point in the week the lack of sleep catches up to me a bit. It’s a fight to stay awake and finish what I’m working on. But I’m willing to do it, cause I know and I’m determined this is the path I wanna go down. I’m confident good things are on the horizon. Thank you for reading today’s blog, I wish you all the best.
