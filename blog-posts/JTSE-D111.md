Hello friends,

<br>

Today I started following a new series on YouTube, as well as put in some time learning Vim and C++.

<br>

## Learning Curve

<br>

It's no surprise that VS Code and Vim differ quite a bit. There are many shortcuts and tricks that I'm just not smooth with yet. In a similar way, this reminds me of when I switched from using Adobe Premiere to DaVinci Resolve. At first things were clunky, I wasn't a fan of feeling like such a noob again. But with time I got faster, learned more tricks, customized it to my needs. Ultimately I was extremely happy with my switch and had it not been for my persistence to learn this new program, I would never know the immense pleasure I have with Resolve. I hope my switch to Vim proves as fruitful. I'm keeping track of the common commands, slowly learning how things work and how to translate things I did in VS Code. It's fun, and honestly the main thing I like about it is that it's built to be fully keyboard accessible. I hate having to use a mouse all the time and if it were possible I would just type everything I need. I hope I can achieve that in Vim.

## C++ & Game Dev

<br>

So I'm following this new series, **_[Creating an RPG](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs6oRBoE2-Q_fX_rzraQekRoL7Kr7s5xi)_**. It's been incredibly informative, and while most of the early concepts are old news to me, I'm trying to see it as new. There are many similarities to C so I can guess at times what it would look like in C++. But I'm excited to get past some of the more lectur-ey bits and start developing a game. I have a ton to learn however since while VS Code handles a lot of lower level things for you, Vim does not. And I'm often at a loss trying to figure out what I don't know. It's an uphill battle but I'm not giving up.

<br>

So far I'm quite enjoying Vim, surprisingly the lack of autocomplete and prettier has not been a bother but instead a refreshing taste of coding. I hope to continue learning Vim, C++, and game development over the next few months. And then share with you all what I create next. Know yourself, where you lack, where you excel, what you need to succeed, because the road to victory is paved only by yourself, friend.
