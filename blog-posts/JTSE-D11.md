Hello,

<br>

So not every day is gonna be full of progress. I'm getting ideas faster than I have time to make them. I think it's important that despite all the ideas coming to me, I stick with projects until fruition. Not until perfection, but at least until things are done.  
On the way to work I did some digging through the Sanity docs. Just to get a better understanding of the schemas, types, and how to use GROQ. I also thought a bit about the downside of using sanity in a TypeScript environment. The typing and refactoring needed everytime you create a new schema is quite repetitive. For example say I want to change my name column to id. Now I need to manually sync 3 files. My type file to reflect a number instead of string, my groq function that retrieves from the database, and of course the schema itself. I looked a bit into some plugins like codegen but haven't quite learned how to implement it yet. But nonetheless I do think it's quite tedious to have to sync all 3 myself, and more than once already has this been a problem. So needless to say I looked at other options. I looked a bit into Payload CMS which seemed like a good alternative, boasting as the TypeScript friendly NextJS CMS. But after looking into it a fair bit I had a realization.

## Just stick it out

<br>

If I keep jumping at every shiny thing I see I'll never finish any project. I'm completely for changing up the stack and trying as many different combinations until I find what sticks. But I think it's best with these smaller projects to use one stack and stick to it. No matter what bugs, what challenges, in the end I'm here to learn. Regardless of if it's learning what I do or don't want. So I'm sticking to sanity, for now. Once I start my next project, yeah, I might switch. Especially since I learn much more through comparisons. Helps reinforce the meaning behind a function or method when I see it done multiple ways.

<br>

So today I didn't have much time to code. I did manage to implement a quick sort feature so that my blog posts were in the right order. I also decided to change up my draft website a bit. I've been sticking hard to the reference website and am now realizing, hey, let's add some of me into this. Let's get creative and maybe I'll find it easier to create things myself rather than try to copy what's been made without knowing how they did it. But all in all, it was a good day, and I'm looking forward to the next.

<br>

Thank you for reading. I'm not sure who would read these all, but if you're here, thank you, I hope you have a great journey.
