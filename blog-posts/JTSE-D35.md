Hello,

<br>

Currently, progress is slow, but ! am slowly setting up the building blocks to allow me to smoothly and efficiently create components in this complicated isometric theme I've decided on. I believe the last time I wrote about it, I mentioned the issue of not knowing at what frequency to implement it. I was inclined to just commit to a full isometric shape design, but I believe that now unfeasible. I think I'm much better off having isometric components here and there, but keeping modest. For the main reason that when it comes to user experience, skewed text isn't the most friendly. It can be cool if kept
sparse.

<br>

## Levels of Development

<br>

Once I settled on isometric design I took it to its most basic problem, make a cube. I've considered ThreeJS, but I'm not fully convinced I should delve into it to make my portfolio. I think it's super cool and the potential is high, but at the moment I just want to keep things simple, continue developing my base CSS and React skills without relying on too many outside tools.

<br>

So back to the main problem, a cube. I outlined solving this issue last blog, but I've since discovered some problems that arise when scaling up and down. It's hard to recreate this snapping type of effect when working with these not super accurate values. So some corners end up a few pixels off, which I need a solution for. In the meantime, I moved on to looking into creating an isometric navbar.

<br>

## Navbar

<br>

I planned to make the navbar isometric but haven't yet figured out how it would pan out. I tried modifying the angles a bit on the cube to make the isometric rectangle more horizontal but decided the website would be more consistent if I stuck to a fixed angle of isometry. I spent the rest of the evening thinking about how I want to display the shapes: I need an easily customizable cube component; one that mainly has controls for size and text.

<br>

But that is all I've got for today, thank you for joining the journey, until tomorrow.
