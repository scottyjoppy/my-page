Hello friends,

<br>

Since I started using Vim I knew that NeoVim was a very popular fork of the text editor, but I was hesitant in trying it. I haven't yet made many changes to my Vim since I wanted to really experience it at the barebones level. But today, I looked into things a bit deeper.

## NeoVim

<br>

So NeoVim is a fork of Vim and has a lot of community developed projects. It's more recently updated and easier to configurate. I not only installed NeoVim, but added some keymapping to make life easier. I'm grateful that I spent a few months with Vim Classic and no remaps because now I fully understand the reasoning behind popular bindings.

While I have yet to play around in NeoVim I'm excited to give it a go and recount my experience through these blogs. Thank you for reading today's blog, I'll see you tomorrow.
