Hello friends,

<br>

Ascii is great, I've also written this word way to much in the last few blogs. I think the art style is really cool but beyond just it being cool, I need to consider what else I'm gonna do with the website.

<br>

Currently I'm overhauling the home page making it a sort of mix between home and about page. I have to decide what content deserves it's own page, and what will be vertically accessible through the home page.

<br>

That's more or less what I've been up to today, slow progress, but it's lookin cool.
