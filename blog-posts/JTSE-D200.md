Hello friends,

<br>

I'm not sure I quite understand the difference but today I wanted to deploy Strapi so I could use it without localhost. 

<br>

## Strapi Cloud

<br>

So the simplest solution starting out seemed to be Strapi Cloud. When I first launched it I had lots of trouble getting my existing data on there. Then the even more annoying thing was that when I wanted to deploy it it always took like 5 minutes. Compared to Vercel which takes a minute at most I thought that just sucked. So I immediately tried running it on Vercel only to be met with the fact that that's not possible. While I'm not entirely sure why it doesn't work on Vercel I was then introduced to Render.com. I just wanted something free and capable of deploying my project file. I had a much simpler time troubleshooting (despite still spending quite some time on it) while mainly going over the errors I've made before. Forgetting the env variables, not building correctly, redirecting to the backend folder in the repo, and the list goes on. I saw much quicker deploying times on Render and yeah I think I'll be sticking with this one for now. I do have to learn however why Vercel doesn't work. I'd really like to know the difference and something like Node is something I definitely should know if I'm getting back into web dev.

That's kinda all for today, been pretty exhausted for today and I'm gonna try and be more consistent with coding and posting my blogs. It's a delicate balance because of all the stuff I'm doing on the other branch contradicts some stuff on this main branch. But I'm sure I can figure it out. Thank you for reading today's blog, until next time, friend.
