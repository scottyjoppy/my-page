Hello,

<br>

Today I spent my coding time in Figma. I had to take some time acclimating myself to the Figma layout. I'm used to Illustrator so at least I'm not coming at this completely fresh. The design process was fun. Using the grid layout I could quickly spin up isometric shapes and spent some time experimenting with designs. One of my visions for the page is an isometric landscape with a train that travels throughout it all. I also spent time finding references online to visualize what I want to even create. The ideas process can be hard at times because I struggle to focus on just one idea. To combat this, lists and forced structure are my friend.

<br>

I'm a bit at a loss for what to write today. It's challenging to spend time designing, because as much as I enjoy it I do feel torn that I'm not coding. This is the struggle I believe many aspiring programmers have where time is the largest factor. Balancing work, family, and other personal hobbies leaves almost no room to learn programming. It's this unfortunate double edged sword of sacrifice that requires give on all sides of your life. It's a constant battle and I feel for anyone going through a similar situation. I hope this blog can capture these raw emotions and can be a lovely time-piece to look back on when I've achieved what I've set out for. I wish you all the best and hope to see you achieve your wildest dreams. Until tomorrow.
