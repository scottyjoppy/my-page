Hello friends,

<br>

I've been reading blogs and browsing websites in my spare time. There's such cool stuff on the internet if you look. [Henry Codes](https://henry.codes) and [Brad Woods Digital Garden]`(https://garden.bradwoods.io) just to name a few, have re-ignited my desire to put interesting stuff on the internet. Let's do just that.

<br>

## Just Browsing

<br>

Whenever I look at these websites I try to take something away with me. Whether it's a cool idea, design choice, styling, I write it all down to keep track of what makes my brain think a website is *cool*. Something I saw today is that someone had an element displaying their most recent listened to song on Spotify, how cool is that! 

<br>

[Indie Web](https://indieweb.org) is a great place to find these website, moreover [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), is good to find cool pages, and interesting blogs. A quick browse of the two has generated a lot of ideas, one main one that I found cool is Ascii art.

<br>

## Ascii

<br>

For the uninitiated, Ascii is the old standard of symbols and chars for phones and computers. Ascii art is art, like this: (>'.')>.

<br>

It's versatility spans beyond short one line designs. You can find various uses such as borders, dividers, patterns, and yes, full artworks. Nothing else for me really captures the theme that is *tech and internet* as Ascii art. 

<br>

While I'm not sure how to exactly integrate this, and a looming fear of having potentially messy code is above me. [This blog](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/) in particular has inspired me to just say fuckit, it's my website, go crazy with it. The standards of website design don't apply. Make something creative, scroll your text, make it huge, make it small, make it upside down. Nothing *HAS* to be a certain way, it should be the way you want it. Your personal page should be a direct expression of you, not a black and white resume. These are the changes I need to make to my page, these are the changes that are coming, soon.
