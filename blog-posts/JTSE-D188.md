Hello friends,

<br>

Today I unfortunately didn't have any time to code. However, I did write down a few ideas for when I remodel this website.

<br>

## Planned changes

<br>

Something I like to do is browse Hacker News posts and write down designs I like from people's personal websites. I currently have a another branch open on this repo awaiting being pushed but the more I think about it, I think I just want to keep things clean and simple. So I'll leave here my current list of planned changes.

<br>

## 1. As few premade components as possible

<br>

I think I'm at the very least at a level now where I can make components myself. Sure for more complicated things I can find some inspiration online but for the simple stuff I should be able to create it on my own. Especially since this website shouldn't have too too much crazy stuff going on.

<br>

## 2. Beige Background

<br>

Not much more to add here, I like beige colored web pages, so I'll make mine so. Which also means no more light and dark modes.

<br>

## 3. Borderless

<br>

When first making the website I really liked thick borders like in this website: ***[Mochi](https://shoppu.mochi.at)***. But looking at it now, I think unless I'm fully indulging into that style it won't really work, well at least. So I think I'll be removing most if not all the thick borders on my website.

<br>

## 4. Highlighting

<br>

This is a subtle change but one that I really love. This along other small things like changing the HTML page title, slight hovering popups like hash symbols, are part of the subtle attentions to detail I'd like my website to be riddled with. While something cool like an interactive isometric page might be cool at first, it lacks the subtle charm of something like changing the highlighting color.

<br>

## 5. Blog Pages

<br>

There are numerous changes I'd like to make to the blog pages such as limiting the amount loaded when going to /blogs. But overall I'd just like them to look nicer, more relaxed, simple, but enjoyable. Mainly how code looks, this is part of the borderless war but I think it could be nice to have them almost blend in with the page. *This is of course still considering that in the future I'll be using a headless CMS to takeover creating the blogs instead of saving hundreds of markdown files*.

<br>

## 6. Projects Page

<br>

This page needs a huge overhaul in general. I think in it's current state it's not a good representation of all the work I'm doing. It only outlines finished larger projects but neglects smaller things and WIP's. I also want it to just look better and be easier to navigate. 

<br>

Overall there are many many changes I want to make to this website. I'll surely need some time to get back in the flow of web development and React, but I think if I start slow and simple. I can make it work, and make it pretty.

<br>

Thanks for reading today's blog as I went on about *Future* changes to the website. Just my daily yapping. Until tomorrow, friend.
