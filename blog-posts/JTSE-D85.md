Hello friends,

<br>

I've unfortunately been in a bit of a slump the past few days. I like to say it's part of the process in anything that there will be times of less intense motivation and push to create. But I won't kid myself and say that I'm giving it my all in these times. I do want to keep this blog series honest and be transparent when I'm not producing as much, but I'd also like to ensure you that these things pass. I will get back into things and it's just a matter of kicking myself in the butt a bit to get back on track. So be on the lookout for progress. I'll see you on the blog again tomorrow, goodbye friends.
