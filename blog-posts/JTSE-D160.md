Hello friends,

<br>

Ughhh.... So I did a bad thing. I tried to shortcut some of this collision stuff by using code I don't understand. I started with a chunk of collision code that seemed to correctly detect when I was within the bounds of a tile. And while that worked, I had no idea how it worked or how to troubleshoot it. It was straight downhill from there. I kept writing code I didn't understand, piling onto this mountain of confusing foreign code which I had no chance at fixing if something went wrong.

## Reset

<br>

After dicking around with this system of copying code, implementing it, fixing it, then it doesn't work, repeat. I decided this is not how I want to do this. I reset everything back to how it was before I went down this rabbit hole. I'm gonna start from square one and learn the math correctly. It will take longer but I'm sure I'll be better off this way. So that was my day, writing a ton of code, then deleting it all. Thank you for reading today's blog, until tomorrow.
