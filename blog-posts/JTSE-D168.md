Hello friends,

<br>

Today I found a fun way to learn about collision, as well I've started reading more (I hate reading).

## Learning Method

<br>

About six months ago I tried ChatGPT's talking feature, I thought it was super cool but the lag and small bugs made it not super fun to use. I recently have experimented with it again and wow it's much better. I sometimes like to pretend I'm on the phone with someone but I'm actually having a conversation with an LLM. It's actually been really helpful to just talk to it, I feel like this is how conversation with it should be. But anyhow today I spent some time just talking to ChatGPT trying to understand first how to define lines and polygons, then how you can detect if they're colliding. While I do need to do some extra research I feel like I have a much better idea of what I'm trying to do and the steps I need to take moving forward. I still need to understand the underlaying math but I feel much closer to understanding than I did a few days ago.

## Machine Learning Ethem Alpaydin

I've been reading this book (the revised MIT Press version) just as a side-quest interest in machine learning and it's actually been quite interesting. Some background info, me and books don't get along. I typically fall asleep anytime I need to read anything. But I'm trying, trying to read in less sleep inducive situations and it's been kinda working. Now I can actually focus on what I'm reading and it's cool. Currently it's just talking about the origins of machine learning, putting the emphasis on data. How a revolution in people just having tons of available data made it possible to train models and try to reason from it. It hints towards everything being predictable given enough data. That's an interesting thought. But it's also up for debate if we will ever be at a point where we can translate everything into data. If there are things in life that will just remain untracked. Who knows, I'm not done the book yet. But it's interesting and I'm hyped to continue reading it.

Progress can be just a minuscule increment forward everyday over a long period of time. I do feel some day's that I'm making no improvement, but it's ultimately up to me to one make the effort everyday to improve, and two, recognize my efforts as that small increment that they are. Be nice to yourself, you're doing great, friend.
