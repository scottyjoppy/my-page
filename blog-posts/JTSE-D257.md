Hello friends,

<br>

While today I couldn't get the printer just yet, I did what I could to make sure I'll be ready tomorrow.

<br>

## The Good Stuff

<br>

So what am I *really* looking for in a printer? The main thing is motors and gears. I still need to figure out the usefulness of the various plastic casings wires and electronics that will be inside, but I know for sure that motors will be of great use. 

<br>

On project I'm hoping to do first once I have some motors on hand is actually to make my own servo. I saw a lot of videos talking about how this is a great starting point to understand how and what servos really are. Which as far as I know, it's just a motor that is more accurate by being electronically controlled by a board (code).

<br>

It seems as if gears will also play a role in making a servo since I need to both use the output of the motor, as well as keep track of how much it's moved.

<br>

I'm still working my way through the overwhelming-ness of all this electronics stuff but I hope slowly but surely I can create a headspace for it and be able to look and understand machines more in depth.
