Hello,

<br>

Today I was able to test out my theories concerning text paths. I also had an idea for a project I could add to my list.

<br>

## SVG TextPaths

<br>

So I want text, and I want it rotated and skewed. While getting text on a path isn't too complicated, getting the desired effects is. You can modify the SVG text elements transform properties to add things like skewX, rotate, and translate, but it doesn't always behave as intended. The problem I was facing is that the origin of the transformations was determined by the larger SVG image, and not just the text element. I have yet to put a bow on this issue but at the very least, hacking together some translates allows me to still see that the skew and rotate make the text look isometric. Yay.

<br>

## Review Basics Idea

<br>

The idea stems from two common problems I have: I would like to know off the top of my head how to code things like sorting algorithms, search trees, and anything that gets abstracted over time. Often, with my notebook in my pocket, I wish I just had something to write. That's when this idea came to mind. I could get prompted once a day or whatever I set it to, with some coding concept and a language. Nothing that would be super complicated, but something quick and useful to know. Then I would just have to write it down on paper or laptop, then send an image or file to the app to compare it to the correct answer. I could go pretty in-depth with how to make this, but hopefully my vision came through a bit here.

<br>

Learning and implementing SVGs this deeply for this page has been quite the learning curve. I'm glad to be learning all of this and I'm sure it will come in handy at some point, but for the time being, it's a grind. I'll keep pushing through and tomorrow I think I'll delve headfirst into creating some hooks. Thanks for reading today's blog, see ya tomorrow.
