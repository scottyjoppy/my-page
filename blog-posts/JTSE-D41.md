Hello,

<br>

<br>

Today I just want to show the levels of design I'm following as I create this isometric image. It all begins here with the blank canvas. From this I had the idea of creating a few islands surrounded by water. So the next step was creating the islands.

<br>

<br>

I line everything up according to the grid to keep things even and isometric. But to add greater depth, I created some vertical lines to the islands. As well, different shading to indicate a light source.

<br>

Next, is the water. I thought of doing this in two layers. One base layer at the bottom like the following.

<br>

Then an additional semi transparent layer for the actual water.

<br>

I could expand on this effect by fading the island depth into nothing but I'll keep things simple for now.

<br>

With the basic landscape in place I built a rough lookin' boat to top things off.

It was fun creating this all. I'm excited to fill this empty landscape with my own little world. More on that tomorrow.
