Hello,

<br>

Not everyday is a huge win, and unfortunately I just didn't have it in me to program. It wasn't so much a matter of having time but more just being so utterly exhausted that my body was just screaming for sleep. These days happen every so often and I think it's best to listen. Today I just wrote up the blog and struggled with some linting errors. Honestly I just didn't have the energy to solve the issue and I had to just leave it and pass out. Not my proudest of days but I do like to still document them honestly. I'm sure anyone on a similar journey is not constantly having amazing days, it's important to be real and honest. So today wasn't the best, but I won't stay down, tomorrow's a new day.
