Hello,

<br>

Today I had the pleasure of starting a project with a friend. It’s my first experience pair programming and I’m excited for all I have to learn from it.

<br>

## Pair Programming

<br>

The are a few benefits I immediately learned from pair programming. First and foremost, in my eight months of coding I’ve never had the chance to see someone’s process besides in a tutorial. I’ve only ever been familiar with my habits and way of typing, and I’ve been lacking this ability to bounce ideas off of someone in code. 

<br>

Collaboration is great. When I was in film, especially in a writing room kinda environment, I really enjoyed this chance to just throw ideas out; to merge work styles and align your goals towards an end product. To solve problems and go through all the possible solutions together. When working alone it’s easy to assume you’re way is best but it’s essential when collaborating to not be grounded in your own preconceptions. Immediately I had to learn some git standards, how to clone a repo, and what SSH was. But most of all I enjoyed learning together. 

<br>

The project involves computer vision and my friend and I had little experience creating anythjng of that sort. We both took some time to research and brainstorm how best to solve the issue of tracking a ball. I was excited to see our brains focus on different aspects of the projects. While this project will be more of a side thing for the two of us, I’m excited to see where it takes us.

<br>

I hope I have more opportunities to work with programmers in the near future. I know I have a lot to learn and it’s really nice to experience different kinds of problem-solving. Thanks for keeing up with today’s blog. I’ll catch you in the next one.
