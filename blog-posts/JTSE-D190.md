Hello friends,

<br>

Some updates on my search for work in the software field, but today I joined a presentation for an upcoming coding academy that would take place in 2026. I really want to get in and have been thinking about the hiring challenge constantly since I applied. I heard from a friend who joined last year that he had to do some sort of web app and they focused on either front or back end. I also heard that the company uses Vue and well well well, there's my excuse to learn Vue aha.

## Vue

<br>

I've been looking for a reason to have a look at view and I'm glad one finally rolled around. I spent today going over some of the docs, making some comparisons to React, and following a startup tutorial on YouTube to get a feel for the environment. I may be a bit presumptuous in saying this but I think I'm gonna like it more than React. At least now just dipping my toes into it, it just "feels" better if that makes sense. There are many many similarities between the two but I also just need to start thinking Vue-ely...

<br>

But tomorrow I get the outline for the assignment so I'm planning on taking some time from the blog while I focus on this assignment. I'll chime in every few days to let y'all know how I'm holding up.

Thank you for reading today's blog, until next time friend.
