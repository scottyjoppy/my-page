Hello friends,

<br>

Today I started writing the code to actually place tiles on the grid. While I didn't get to far I will recount what was actually achieved.

<br>

The main change was in how the tiles themselves are loaded. Currently I'm just loading a single tilesheet and extracting one tile from it. I had to import and modify the logic that will instead break down the tilesheet into an array that can be referenced by index.

<br>

The tutorial I was watching got caught up in an error about creating a pointer function so I didn't get too much further than that. Thank you for reading today's very short update, until tomorrow.
