Hello,

<br>

Today marks day 30 of the daily blog! I like tracking progress like this cause I often forget what progress I’ve made. At the end of the month, I tend to just believe I did nothing, but having all these blogs to look at definitely helps quell those fears. But enough of that, what did I do today?

<br>

## React May Meetup

<br>

Luck would have it that I was at the location a full two and a half hours early. I did plan for this and brought my laptop so I could continue to struggle with my markdown conversion problem. I quickly implemented the CSS empty line fix I discussed yesterday, which worked well enough. I then proceeded to argue with Gemini about crafting the perfect prompt for it to compute. Gemini came out on top, and I still have yet to figure this out. I think it’s time to take a break from this problem and tackle some other changes I wanted to make to the website. So more to come on that!

<br>

The meetup was nice. Met a cool guy who showed me his geography learning app **_[GeoChamp](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6477741110)_**. Really clean and easy to use tool. But in general I was just happy to talk to someone with a project like this. One of my main questions when I meet people is what kind of projects they do in their off-time. I’m always happy to hear about their development process and innovative use of tech.

<br>

Besides that, the meeting was alright. Unfortunately, I’m assuming they had some trouble getting some React speakers; it felt like the talks were not really about React but instead about other tools and tech fairly separate from React. No shade to the quality of the talks— I think they were really nice; I was just hoping to learn more anout React. Nonetheless, the first talk was about a neat productivity tool called **_[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)_**. From the demos, it seemed like this kind of middle ground between a CLI and a GUI; it marries the keyboard first approach and speed of a CLI, with the user-friendly and visual aspects of a GUI. All in all it seems like a cool tool, and I just found out there’s an IOS version, which I will check out now.

<br>

The second talk was all about shaders. He went pretty in-depth explaining the process of rasterisation and vectorisation, supersampling anti-aliasing, and triangles. But honestly most of it went over my head. What I did enjoy, however was the live coding in Godot. He created a water droplet and made a water-rippling animation all the while showing us how the shadersare being applied.

<br>

Overall, it was a nice meetup, but again, I’m still hoping the next one will be more React focused. I’m sure the ever growing React community here would love to see that.

<br>

That is all for today, thanks for reading and I'll be back tomorrow!
