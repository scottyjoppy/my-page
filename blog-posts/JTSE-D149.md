Hello friends,

<br>

Today I started thinking about what I want to do next. Well I've already thought about it a bit so today I just settled on an idea.

<br>

## What Is It Alex??

<br>

A Foddian Game. Similar genre to the likes of "Getting Over It", "Jump King", "Chained Together", basically a platformer with few checkpoints making it more rage inducive when you make a mistake. I'm not entirely sure how it will turn out but I also had the idea of making it on an isometric map. To emphasize that upwards movement and hopefully give it a cute, simple pixel art style.

<br>

There's lot's I gotta figure out in order to make this game. While I do know some basics of SFML C++ and game development I'm still an ultra noob. But the best way to learn is to do so here I am, doing.

<br>

That's all I really have for today, hope to show some game updates tomorrow, when I begin. Until then, friend.
