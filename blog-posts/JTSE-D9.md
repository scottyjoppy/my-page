Hello,

<br>

Yet another day of tinkering with framer motion. Still lovin' it. Had some hiccups with hooks where I was trying to detect the y scroll position to change the class of my hero section. But I discovered how easy it is to create these infinite loops that just glitch out the whole website. They're a very meticulous thing hooks and I'm sure I'll discover that more and more using React.

## Reflection

<br>

Had a lovely talk with my wife today and we discussed my tendency to obsess over things. I've long know this about myself, this habit in which I get in these phases where I'm completely immersed in a task or problem. Where everything else becomes a blur, and I'm forced to sit there and solve it to get out of this. This can be both good and bad.  
It's good in the sense that I can really push myself to find a solution. I'm determined to keep working at something hard, until it's solved. On the downside, I can get stuck on sometimes unsolveable tasks - or let me rephrase, tasks that will take way too long to do. Where I can't think of eating, sleeping, or anything else until it's done. This is not great.

<br>

The reason I bring this up is because I think I need to change this when it comes to code. I'm currently working on this draft website and I can see myself spiraling down the well of never-ending fixes and features that leave me perfecting a project that doesn't need perfecting. I believe most of the time I'm stuck it's on something stupid, something that is the cause of inexperience. When I build my PC I spent over 5 hours just plugging in cables (omitting the time spent actually cable managing). I just don't have enough experience. So that is why I believe it is beneficial to build many projects, but not try to perfect every single one. I should get them to a point where I'm happy, but heed myself to hard deadlines otherwise the end is never.  
In the coming month I plan on beginning a new challenge of creating a project a week. I think this will be good practice to learn how to get efficient, and avoid over-complicating things. So stay posted!

<br>

Thank you for joining as I thought out loud for a bit. Sometimes thoughts become clearer when you can look at them.
