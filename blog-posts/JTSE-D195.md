Hello friends,

<br>

So yes now I'm looking to update this website and I just wanted to go over some of the additions I would like to add from perusing a few blogs on my own time.

<br>

## Color Scheme

<br>

This change ties into two main changes. The first being that while simple, my current black and white theme should change. I'm not going super crazy but I'm quite a fan of earth tones like beige, and if I having a simple secondary like pastel green. I also currently have my theme changing button just commented out but I think I'll remove that option entirely, better to focus on just one look of the overall website and stick to it. On the same topic I want to remove all borders. Currently I've been using this kinda style where I have these thick black borders everywhere but I want that to change. I've become a fan of the simple no border design with the occasional drop shadow to separate elements. So I'll implement that in the coming update.

<br>

## No Premade Components

<br>

While I don't frown upon using these types of components this portfolio page is more to showcase my skills and knowledge of frontend and backend development. I think I'm doing a disservice to myself by simply using other people's copy paste solutions. And this way I can keep the code consistent in my own "words" throughout the site. On a similar note I want to move all my tailwind classes to proper CSS classes. After doing so in the calendar project I much prefer to have everything in it's own CSS file than inline with the HTML. Easier to edit that way as well.

<br>

## Expandable

<br>

I think one of the main problems with the page is I have no easy way of expanding things. If I want to add a new project per say I need to edit like 4 files and do everything manually. While I don't think I'll go as far yet as to use a headless CMS, I think I'll try to have something like a solid excel sheet that I can just add details in and boom the website is updated. I just didn't know how to think or code in this way in the past so now is a good opportunity to rework things to meet that standard.

<br>

## Anchors!

<br>

This is just a cool think I saw but also ties into something I want more of: simple animations. In a lot of blogs I saw something simple like a hashtag that shows up when you hover over the title of a section. Some of them were just for show but others were actual anchor points that would scroll your screen to align with that section. I think that could be a cool simple thing to add to the site to both show an understanding of blog practices and CSS stylings. As well I think simple animations are nice. For example the Water Me project has a lot of cute little animations like when you hover over buttons but I think that is even too much. I just want something simple. Because if it's too complicated one it's a lot of work for not much reward, but also it's just gonna slow the website down which I don't want either.

<br>

So these are just a few of the changes I want to implement. There's other things like limiting the blogs on the blog page, more responsiveness for mobile, and handling for various browsers. But I think I want to keep this list as concise and manageable as possible, can't keep avoiding this game project forever aha. But that's all for today, thank you for reading today's blog, until next time friend.
