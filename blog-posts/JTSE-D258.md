Hello friends,

<br>

Today's the day! Let's tear apart a printer.

<br>

## How To Rip It

<br>

I didn't want to just immediately take a hammer to this thing and forage everything I could. No, I wanted to at least try to be somewhat methodical about this all. First plan of attack, remove every single screw. Just keep unscrewing things until things come apart and hopefully- reveal more screws.

<br>

This works for a bit, turning the printer upside down and repeating the process there. But the next move is to start attacking the wires. Disconnect everything (unless it's important to know where it's connected- in my case nope). 

<br>

With all the screws gone and the wires disconnected you're really almost all the way done. The tougher parts come when you have to recognize what is unscrew able, and what is soldered / built in. But when I came across those pieces, the ol' force it till it snaps seemed to work.

<br>

## Aftermath

<br>

After dismembering this free printer, I was left with quite a few gears, 4 solid metal rods, 4 DC motors, bunch of springs & wires, and some circuits which I'm not sure if they're useful or not.

<br>

And as the sun set, I cleaned up the mess, and rested.
