Hello friends,

<br>

Today while I didn't do too much programming, I took the first steps towards map creation.

<br>

## How To Make Maps

<br>

I'm lucky that I've indulged in many RPG coding series in the past on YouTube so I already have a basic understanding of how maps are made. More and more I'm piecing together how it will all work. Maps are generally made from an array. Each box in the array holding an ID which represents a specific tile in a tile sheet. Since I've already had to load player textures with sprite sheets it's very similar to do so for with maps. The difference is that instead of loading just one image at a time, you're creating two arrays. One assigning an ID to every tile, and one that is the actual map. I'm excited to learn actual map generation and start to make my game come to life a bit more.

I'm just barely scratching the surface of game development with this project but already I'm super excited. I can't wait to keep learning and see where this path leads. Thank you for reading today's blog, until tomorrow.
