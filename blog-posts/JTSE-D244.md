Hello friends,

<br>

Today and yesterday I unfortunately haven't had much time or energy to code but I have been trying to do a bit of research on the components I have on the way.

<br>

[Tinker Cad](https://www.tinkercad.com) has a few tutorials to go over the basics of breadboards so I completed those doing some research on all the little questions I had along the way. Like understanding the coloured lines on a resistor, series vs parallel circuits, and some interesting concepts like sound. 

<br>

In one of the tutorials the circuit uses various resistances in combination with a 555 chip to play different sounds. Being a musician I'm excited at the possibilities in this domain, like making a cute little piano from a breadboard would be a fun idea.

<br>

Now that I'm moving from the intangible coding realm to the physical one, the ideas that are flowing to me are really exciting, I can't wait to start creating.
