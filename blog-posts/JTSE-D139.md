Hello friends,

<br>

Today I committed everything to Github to start versioning the project.

<br>

## Git Init

<br>

I've had trouble with the process of making a repo for a while. I follow the steps, git init, pull if I need, add everything, commit the code, then push upstream. But for the life of me I couldn't figure out why I always had problems. Today I figured out why. The problem lies in a change made in 2022. The core Github branch changed from Master to Main. I believe the plugins I'm using to interact with Github has been initializing everything to the master branch resulting in errors. Knowing that I could now be more careful and correctly initialize and push my project.

<br>

## ~~Map~~LevelLoader

<br>

The other change I made today was changing any logic using the name map to the name level. I figured since I'm not creating maps per say, I should give it an appropriate name. So I modified the names everywhere, as well as the data I'm retrieving from the text file.

<br>

That's all I did for today. Slowly but surely I'm converting this RPG game into Space Invaders. Thank you for reading and spending your time here today, I will be back tomorrow!
