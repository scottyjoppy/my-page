Hello friends,

<br>

Here we are entering the new year, now on my 224nd blog, and looking back I've definitely learned a lot. I'm glad to say that I've been able to keep up this blog despite some no code days, grouped days, lack of motivation, and poor time management. It's nice to have something to be proud of. My drive to learn programming continues strong. But more and more I feel like I just want to get into robotics. I definitely gave web dev it's due time, I don't feel I gave game development the same but it was very useful in teaching me many new and important skills. Like coding in C++, using a text editor, how game loops work, how to code physics simulations and game collision. I still feel as if I was just beginning to learn in that department. But I can't stomach this drive to start learning robotics.

<br>

My brain sometimes feels like it's just on hold until I begin robotics. There's a lot of built up excitement and I think once I'm done updating this website fully. I'll begin. Just a matter of time. Here's to 2026, I'm excited to see where I'm at by the end.
