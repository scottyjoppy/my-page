Hello friends,

<br>

So I've been working on this assignment for the past few days and I just wanted to share how things have been so far, spoiler alert I've been having a blast.

<br>

## How It's Been

<br>

It's a similar feeling to doing LeetCode questions or FCC daily challenges, just longer, and more complicated. I decided to focus more on the front-end aspect of this assignment, mainly because I'm just more confident in explain design choices than how I created the database and the rest of the backend. I'm being much more conscientious of my AI usage on this project as I want it to be as *Me* as possible. I'm finding myself mainly using AI to explain some Vue standards, and how I can do things I would normally do in React. 

<br>

The project itself is to create a calendar which can store and display events. Specifically those of sports teams and tournaments. I'm going a little balls to the wall expanding every requirement to the max but honestly I'm actually just incapable of doing the bare minimum, or anything near that. For example they say to just show one or two months, and I made an algorithm that could properly display multiple centuries of calendars aha... I'm also avoiding any premade components (besides the logo I'm swiping off the company's website hehe). But I am allowing myself to get inspired by calendars I like, like the Google calendar. Of course I'm not just going in the dev tools and copying the CSS bar for bar, but instead I'm trying to infer from looking, and trying out my own CSS knowledge until it works. I find myself using Tailwind to pull things up quickly, but naturally convert everything to CSS once it's settled.

<br>

Overall I've been really loving this assignment, I just hope I can keep everything within reason and get it done in time. Today I finished things off by creating all the table relations and using AI to quickly give me some values in the database to work with (a great use of AI). And I also had my first experience with Vue router which I think I get, sorta, mainly because it's (in terms of client side rendering) similar to React.

<br>

I'll leave y'all off with this update today. Thank you for reading today's blog, until the next update!
