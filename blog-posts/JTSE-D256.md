Hello friends,

<br>


So today something unexpected happened, I got a 3D printer.

<br>

## What

<br>

In the midst of all this new learning I'm embarking on with electronics, robotics, and all these hardware components- now I have 3D printing. As a lovely surprise my co-worker gifted me this 3D printer they weren't using and now here we are.

While it by no means is a new printer, my new Monoprice Select Mini V1 should hopefully be a decent entry into this whole 3D printing thing. I already knew one day I would love a 3D printer, the day just came much sooner than expected. 

<br>

In the realm of electronics 3D printing will be really useful, now I can create custom casing and parts to suit my builds. Really just a fantastic add to the inventory. 

<br>

However yes, learning 3D modelling is something I'm definetly not ready to do at the moment, I'm sure I will have plenty of use just taking stuff from the internet and printing for fun. Really just a great unexpected day. Until the next one friend.
