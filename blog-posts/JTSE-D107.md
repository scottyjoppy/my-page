Hello friends,

<br>

As I've mentioned in the earlier blogs, I come from a background of film and music. Coding is newer and I love it with all my heart, but it's nice to go back to film and photography once in a while.

## New Tools

<br>

Just focusing on photo editing, there has been such an evolution of QoL features since I first started. I mainly use Photoshop and Lightroom, but would be open to using something else in the future if the tools are up to par. For Photoshop, the selection tools have changed dramatically over the years. From painstakingly magnetic lasso-ing over your subject to just pressing a button, we are in the future. Generative fill, content-aware remove, editing photos has never been easier. On the lightroom side it's super simple to make portrait edits like teeth whitening, eye brightening, masking, even things like changing the whole sky is as simple as pressing a button. More and more, "I'll fix it in post" seems like less a sacrilege to say. I remember when the first audio AI noise remover came out, it was revolutionary. I could take crappy bar audio and make it seem like I used near-studio quality equipment in a tempered room. 

<br>

While tools like this scare people I like to look at the positive. For one exclusivity is less of a thing the skill requirement drops drastically. Some might argue the joy of the craft is less so, and I can understand to an extent. But for example, I have no problem and no loss of joy skipping the hours and hours of minute editing to remove a photobomber in my picture. Things are easier now, let's enjoy that and use our time for harder problems.

<br>

Thank you for reading my blog completely not about coding. I hope it was still enjoyable in some way. There is value in moving with the times, instead of spending all your energy fighting it, friend.
