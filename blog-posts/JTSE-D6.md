Hello,

<br>

I'm a big fan of the CSS Grid. Ever since I started using it I've tried implementing it in my projects. Especially since starting to use Tailwind's responsive breakpoint classes, it's so easy to adapt my grid to any screen. As for the challenge of using grid, when starting out I frequently used this online tool **_[CSS Grid Generator](blog-posts/JTSE-D5.md)_** to help with visualizing how the grids will look.

<br>

Part of the joy in this project is taking a website like **_[Momence](https://momence.com)_** and trying to recreate as much of it as I can. It's a great learning experience.  
DevTools allow you to view any webpage's HTML and CSS. I use this a lot to try and deduce how Momence for example organized their grids, or how they implemented various images and links on their webpage. DevTools are especially important when looking at my own website. Useful in the sense that when I have a random element being pushed to the left for no reason I can dive in and find out exactly which div is inadvertently applying too much left padding. Especially given React's component based programming where a div can be embedded so deep and affected by so many parent elements, it's extraordinarily useful to view exactly what is doing what.

## Work Thoughts

<br>

I'm absolutely loving the **_[Syntax](https://syntax.fm)_** podcast. In a recent episode they talk about their experience freelancing, which had me thinking. I've done a bit of freelancing in the past, not coding but video editing. Suffice it to say I wasn't a fan of the uncertainty. Especially now, living in Austria the health insurance benefits of working at a place and not on your own are tremendous. So it's a bit scary to consider a freelancing career. But uncertainty is the biggest obstacle, finding clients, and showing them that I can build them something great. Although, with every project it becomes easier to create a website. To implement features, style it, connect a database... It seems more and more possible. I definitely want to get some more projects under my belt and polish up a portfolio of sorts (this site). But I'm open to the possibility of freelancing. But I'm not ready for risks of that sort at the moment. We'll see again in a few months.

Thank you for keeping up with day 6 of the blog. Another day in the books.
