Hello friends,

<br>

Today was not a very productive day. I have to learn to be okay with that at times. However, it feels like today I'm hitting a new low in terms of motivation, and overall happiness. It's tough. And before I rant a bit about my feelings in relation to this career shift into tech, I'll admit that today I only managed a little research, and little to no coding. Gotta stay honest.

<br>

Oddly enough I feel most productive on day's where I have less time to code. That is of course, when I don't have a plan. Today I had the whole day open but didn't have a plan of attack. With a light setback in the morning that brought my mood way down, today was just tough. I feel like I can dig a deep grave, and once in it, it's really really hard to get out. You are your own worse enemy, and on days like today I can feel that ring so true. I wish I got more done today but alas, here we are. I think the brick wall that is this notification thing is really bringing me down. I just feel dumb, and wish that I could move on from this and skip to the good part. It's a trivial part in learning to break through tough challenges in order to grow your understanding as deeply as you can. It's even more trivial to know when you're in it. Today I struggled with that, I'll be honest about it. Tomorrow is a new day, I can only try to climb my way out of this hole. I'll think of all the others climbing out of their own self-made graves. Thank you honestly for reading if you are here, I wish you the best, friend.
