Hello friends,

<br>

Today unfortunately was not a great day. I was bedridden and resting pretty much the entire day and had no strength to code. I spent a little bit of time still banging my head at the SFML issue and have only taken on micro step in the direction of solving it. I'll have to revisit it tomorrow with a level head. Thank you for reading today's quick update.
