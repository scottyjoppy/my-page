Hello friends,

<br>

Since beginning to play around with storage buckets, I've been faced with a dilemma, shit ain't free.

<br>

## Hindsight 2020

<br>

Thinking back to when I started using these powerful technologies like Supabase, NextJS, Prisma, I had so little knowledge that free tiers looked like they'd last forever. Looking at it now I would slap myself to be more careful before building a whole website on the shoulders of these giants, giants which are only able to get so big...for free.

<br>

The Supabase 2 project limit has been really biting me in the ass lately. I'm at a place where I could really benefit from having available projects online for people to look at. But I have to pick very carefully. At the point I'm at now, I need to use one free project for this page, and am left with just one more slot. I can't choose.

<br>

## What Now?

<br>

At this point I'm faced with two options. Redo everything, learn how to build my own PostgreSQL database and find a hosting service that will still cost me but slightly less than Supabase (this is all at the cost of all of Supabase' backend services, ). Or suck it up and push through until the next big website update. 

<br>

The first step is making the mistake, check. Now it's a matter of not making it again. I've learned my lesson, look at the limits, examine what I'll need from any given provider, don't lock myself into something that will kill me down the road. The best option is to build my own stuff, and only use paid services to handle hosting, at least that's what my current point of view is. In the meantime I'll just have to make things work. The next project won't be with Supabase but I'm also very confident I can figure another service out relatively quickly. Don't tie yourself down with a platform you're not ready to commit to.
