Hello friends,

<br>

I think that's it, I think I'm ready to put this one aside and move on. I'm thrilled to say it works, in the most basic way it works. There are a few bugs yes, and I'm certain I can tweak, improve, and upgrade every part of the project. But it works, and I'm happy about that.

<br>

## Last Looks

<br>

The first thing I did today was add some SVG's to the home page, as well as style the boxes to fit on mobile. I then deleted a pointless /home route I had. Then I finished things off with the README file. I'm gonna use the app myself for some time and make a list of some potential fixes to make if I find the time. But it's done, I'm finally done this project.

<br>

## Lessons

<br>

This project has taught me so much. It all started as this quick burst of excitement to create something, which turned into a month long labour of love. I learned more about React, Supabase, Vercel, I learned about authentication, using API routes, notifications, sending emails, and so much more. Honestly this one project really broadened my mind about many aspects of web development. And it's with that in mind, that I'd like to to broaden my horizons even more, with game development.

<br>

## A Switch

<br>

I've mentioned before that I wanted to delve back into C and learn C++ in the hopes of learning some off-web programming. I think there's a lot of value there and I'm really excited to get started. I think it's best if I take a bit of time to update my page a bit, but then I'd like to get straight into game development.

<br>

I've also recently noticed a large spike in page viewership since I bought the alx-d.com domain name. I welcome you all, friends and I hope you may find some enjoyment as I share my journey in programming and more. I hope one day I can share in a more entertaining manner such as video, but for now, hopefully my words are enough. Thank you for reading today's blog, and know that time is the biggest test of them all, if you can withstand that, you can withstand anything, friend.
