Hello,

<br>

It's been a tough road but I'm slowly starting to see the light at the end of this authentication tunnel. I've been having a hard time both making things work at a basic level, and understanding the underlying logic that forms "authentication". One of the largest issues I'm facing is the depreciation of old ways to authenticate. Most AI models aren't exactly up to date when it comes to specifically Supabase Auth. Additionally, I'm hard pressed to find recent YouTube content outlining how to go about things. But today I found a pretty helpful video: **_[The Right Way to do Auth with the Next.js App Router](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6UvgfSIjQ0)_**.

## Levels Of Understanding

<br>

The first step in understanding something is to know what you don't know. Can't fight demons you don't know about. From watching this video, reading the docs, chatting with ChatGPT, I realized my main issue, is outdated information. I learned to mainly rely on the docs for my source of updated information. As Supabase's docs are actually very well made and helpful. Not only are they updated, but also include very relevant up-to-date information on exactly what I'm trying to do. But then comes the issue of coding things that aren't explicitly stated in the docs. That's when the understanding has to step in. That part I'm working on. My main three methods of learning are watching YouTube videos, reading the docs, and having discussions with an LLM. I find the last to be extremely useful in understanding as I can ask such ridiculous specific questions that pertain to my exact project. Like I've said in the past, currently AI is my mentor`, not the best mentor but better than none. One day I'll get there.

<br>

There's not much else to today. I'm very confident tomorrow will be a much more accomplished blog. This whole Auth thing has definetly set me back about a week, but I'm hopeful next time I have to implement Auth I'll be so much quicker. Thank you for keeping up with today's blog, I'm due for some rest and I'll tackle this issue full force tomorrow!
