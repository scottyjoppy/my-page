Hello,

<br>

Today I put the finishing touches on the Eversports draft website. I’m far from being 100% happy with it but I came to a realization. I spent too long on unimportant things. I gotta be more efficient in how I plan the layout, the components, and general execution of the website. I’m a bit of a perfectionist and it takes a lot to just accept where a project is at and move on. I just thought I would learn better from making more sites than just scratching my head perfecting one. I think it’s also a better visualizer to see how my workflow improves over time.

<br>

## What Now?

<br>

This website needs some love. So as I solidify my plan going forward, I’ll spend some time doing the following:

- Streamlining my blog and project posts through Sanity.io
- Adding some of my newly learned (_Framer_) Motion animations.
- Mobile display optimization
  Not directly related to the site but I would also like to learn how to create basic scripts. A good piece of advice I heard on a podcast, “Anything you do more than once should be automated”. One example being this blog. It’s little but having to update the number by one every day is in efficient at best. As well, making and executing the same

<br>

```cli
git add .
git commit -m "day{number}"
git push
```

<br>

Has been bugging me like crazy over the past few weeks.

<br>

## What After?

<br>

My plan afterwards is rough but I think I know what I’ll do. My main issue now in finding a job is, I have no work to show for it. Additionally, I have little to no time to code; at least not enough to create something extravagant. So the solution, get better and more efficient with my time. I'm talking going into every project with a clear-cut schedule and plan of attack. Deadlines are everything so I will call this the 11 Hour Challenge. Where I'm given 11 hours to create a webpage. Of course I can plan for as long as I want but coding time is 11 hours.

<br>

## Why 11 Hours?

<br>

The way I see it: every weekday I maybe have one hour to code on average. On weekends, I have more but I'll say three hours. That leaves me with 11 hours every week. I'm confident with the right planning I can make it in that time.  
But I won't start that yet, first, let's optimize this website.

<br>

Thanks for reading todays blog. Glad to have a project down and even more excited for the next. Stay tuned.
