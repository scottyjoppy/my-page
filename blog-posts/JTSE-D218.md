Hello friends,

<br>

The past few days have just been a combination of work and taking some mental time off for Christmas time. Like I wrote in the end of the last blog, I've been considering all the steps forward I could take. It's a scary world out there full of unpredictability. Above all, time is a relentless being incessantly pushing you closer and closer to the end. It's truly terrifying. This and being constantly haunted with feelings of inadequacy and being behind everybody else. It's a constant fight to stay in the light. I've had some time to think the past few days and I'm realizing more and more that I need to expand my thoughts. Do whatever I can to not feel in a rush. To accept where I'm at and the realistic time necessary to get to where I want. There are no shortcuts in life. But if I don't start, time won.
