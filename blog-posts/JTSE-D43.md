Hello,

<br>

Today I found myself back on the ***[FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org "freecodecamp.org")*** page. A place I haven’t been since I started programming. After a few months of doing the FCC course, I switched to the Harvard CS50 course which has been incredibly beneficial for me. Afterwards, I started creating on my own. Learning based on my own interests, which has led me to where I am today. At times however, I fear I may be lacking in fundamental knowledge, and with the lack of a computer science degree, I believe I may be getting overlooked by recruiters. 

<br> 

I’ve really been enjoying designing my little isometric world for the portfolio. But as fun as it is, I worry that I should be coding more. So in an effort to continue learning while still making progress on designs, I returned to FCC.

The course content has been updated a lot since I was last here. Which I’m very happy about. I’m following the JS Algorithms and Data Structures course. I remember what I liked about the challenges, the freedom in it. Today’s challenge involved validating phone numbers. FCC challenges are similar to LeetCode problems, but with a ton of test cases to fully guide you to learn and complete it. However, the way in which you solve the challenge is fully up to you. I also did some guided work on sorting algorithms which I’m in definite need of a refresher on. The abstraction of a .sort method allows you to work so much quicker but a good programmer should have a good idea what’s going on under the hood. 

<br>

So suffice it to say I’m pretty happy with the work I did today. I’m moving at a pretty good pace through the coursework and I have the clear goal of getting some concrete proof of my programming skills to add to my CV. Thank you for following today’s update on the journey; see ya tomorrow.
