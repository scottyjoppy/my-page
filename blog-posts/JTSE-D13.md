Hello,

<br>

From the very start of watching CSS tutorials, ***[Kevin Powell](https://youtube.com/@kevinpowell?si=EHfKl9ZiB8hpzoV5)*** has time and time again been creating in-depth, simple to understand, videos. Today, although I didn’t have time to code, I learned how to use the sticky position.

<br>

## Sticky

<br>

As I wrote yesterday, sticky was my least understood CSS position. I must correct myself as I wrote that absolute and relative were the key to parallaxing, sticky is that key. Understanding sticky has clicked something in my brain where I can now clearly visualize how to structure my sections to have fun parallaxing. 

<br>

Once again, sticky is similar to the fixed position. The main difference being that sticky is relative to it’s parent container. Which means I can manipulate where my element is much easier than with fixed.

<br>

Where I was right yesterday was when I wrote absolute positioning is needed for overlap. This remains true for elements that I don’t want to be fixed necessarily, but I can also wrap multiple overlapped elements in a sticky to create this kinda grouped parallax effect.

<br>

## Reflection

<br>

For as fascinating sticky is I am aware that it isn’t much. Not everyday will be full of time and equal in how much I can code. This journey requires me to stay flexible and if I can’t learn through code, I head to YouTube, or to a podcasts, or read some docs. Learning at least one thing new a day is what I aim for. 

<br>

This blog is a challenge to document my daily jourmey to software engineer. But it’s not a challenge I can fail, and even then, software engineer is just a step up, much more to come next. 

<br>

Thank you for your time, time is precious and if you were here spending some of yours, I thank you, dearly.

<br>
