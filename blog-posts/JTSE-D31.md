Hello,

<br>

Despite being at a standstill between me and AI prompts, I decided today to switch gears and look into other updates I could make to the site, mainly style updates.

<br>

## Diving in Headfirst

<br>

I immediately started changing the home page. Switching up the font, refactoring my grid boxes and so on. After a whopping ten minutes I realised I need a plan. If I want this website to be done well and truly represent my skills as a programmer, I need to take more than one stress-filled evening to do so. So I made a plan.

<br>

## The Plan

<br>

Popped up my Notion app and began to think of some ideas of how things could look. I decided to look at some references in order to get a better understanding of what I like and don’t like. The developer **_[Anthony Sistilli](https://youtube.com/@anthonysistilli?si=F4tmf6fEL8vNqJlY)_** has a lovely youtube series ranking and reviewing coding portfolios. He regularly outlines the best and worst practices when it comes to how your page should look. On top of that, him and his community keep a comprehensive **_[list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EGRT9yiERDnPuc_p3KzERbEKK_n4BeoqyxoTF6Sk6YQ/edit?usp=sharing)_** of all the viewed portfolios with rankings.

<br>

This planning not only gave me a better idea of how I’m gonna approach this remodel, but a realistic sense of time for how long this will take. This way, I can section off evenings to work on specific features, as well as order the changes in the most optimal way. I have to account for the fact that I’m only able to put in an hour or two of work a day, with little opportunity to fix test and fix bugs the rest of the day. Nevertheless, I’m excited to get started.

<br>

## Algebra

<br>

A little note in math before wrapping up today’s post. I’ve always loved math. It’s possible my high-school level math class wasn’t enough to push me to the burning hate most people have for the subject. Regardless, I enjoy doing math. Since immersing myself in programming I’ve been glad to hear that math plays a big role. Specifically when it comes to algorithms, computation, and robotics. Everything boils down to a bunch of calculations.

<br>

Like I’ve mentioned before, my lunch breaks are usually spent watching some kind of educational content. Today I was searching for a lecture and came across this video posted by FreeCodeCamp: **_[College Algebra by Dr. Linda Green](https://youtu.be/LwCRRUa8yTU?si=aa--yRXoInUBSwfS)_**. What I reviewed today: Exponent Rules and Simplifying Exponents. I’m sure I’ve gone over this stuff in high-school but it was nice and nostalgic to review this kind of math . Remember simplifying tricks like how:

- 1/x^-2
is
- 1/(1/x^2)
also is
- x^2

Neat! I understand this is very simple but still, I’m sure at one point this stuff will be useful, maybe.

<br>

That’s all for today. I gave myself some direction for the following week or four. Excited to share the site once it’s complete. But thanks for keeping up with day 31, onwards!
