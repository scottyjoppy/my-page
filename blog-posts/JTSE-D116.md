Hello friends,

<br>

Today, since I had a properly installed SFML library, I actually spent some time testing it out.

<br>

## Shapes

<br>

I followed a tutorial on the **_[SFML page](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/3.0/graphics/shape/#antialiased-shapes)_** to make a few shapes. Wasn't anything crazy but I tried some rotating, positioning, adding colors, outlines, and making polygons. It wasn't anything crazy, but luckily my little CSS experience helped me understand transform origins when it comes to rotating and pivot points.

<br>

I'm really enjoying Vim more and more and I can imagine the efficiency once I commit the shortcuts to memory. Once again I'll be keeping the blog short today but I'm glad to say I'm still learning and making progress on my holiday. Thanks for joining me today, until tomorrow, friend.
