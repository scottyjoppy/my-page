Hello friends,

<br>

Today I've just been anxiously waiting for the arrival of my components. I feel like I'm just twiddling my thumbs nervously checking up on the tracking app. It sucks. But in the meantime I want to work on a new web app, one to help me learn German.

<br>

## The Concept

<br>

Essentially I want to be able to work with an excel sheet, in which I can save rows outlining a word, it's type, article, if it's a verb it's partner verb, and the English translation. I want then to be able to semi randomly loop through the words and then with each take note on a scale of 1-5 how well I know it. This would then contribute to the words rating and based on that rating I would skew the frequency in which I see the word.

<br>

## The Implementation

<br>

I spent most of the day getting things to work with Vue. I think the sad thing is that I do believe Vue is better, but unfortunately I'm just way more familiar with React and getting React apps on the web. I wasted a lot of time today just having to relearn routing and also had the realization that I couldn't use the same framework NextJS since it's made more so for React. I tried working with Next but to no avail.

<br>

I ended the day being able to pull info from the google sheet but from an API key. Before leaving off I realized that if I want to modify the data (change the rating or edit words from the webapp) I need to use the API differently. Yay.

<br>

This project isn't too hot on my mind. Really I just want to test things out and get something I can use soon to learn German better. That's why I think this project is just gonna be a vibe coding project. I want to think as little as possible, but instead just guide an AI on how to implement what I'm thinking. Interesting to let go of the ropes in this way but I'm assuming I'm gonna have a lot to think about with electronics so it would be nice to clear my head for that instead.\

Thanks for reading today's blog, until the next one, friend.
