Hello friends,

<br>

Today I took a step away from Water Me project and focused on this page a little.

<br>

## Domains

<br>

Since I got a domain for the Water Me project, I thought it would make sense that my main page also have a custom domain. Especially after realizing they're relatively inexpensive, I decided to make the change. I looked for a while at available names, trying to find something with a good TLD, like .com or .net. The Water Me project has a .eu TLD which I thought would be okay, but I'm hoping this webpage is more internationally accessible so I went with **_[alx-d.com](alx-d.com)_**.

<br>

## Projects Tab

<br>

Now that I have a new project, I wanted to update the projects tab of this page. As I was doing so, I thought something most programmers think when looking at old code they wrote. "This sucks!". I had to hold back the urge to just completely rewrite everything. There was so much inefficiency and I really didn't make it easy on myself to create new projects. I think as I revisit this page I'll find many things of that sort, but for now, I got it working, and moved on.

<br>

Today was a positive reminder that I'm learning and that I'm growing as a programmer. The fact that I can notice mistakes and potential improvements is great! It means I have enough experience to draw on to know what works and what doesn't. Additionally, the ability to say, "This sucks, but I need to finish what I was doing first", is a big thing. But with the additional foresight to add it to the todo list. Thank you for reading today's blog, knowing yourself, is the first challenge, friend.
