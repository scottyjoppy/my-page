Hello friends,

<br>

I've spent the last few days coming up with a plan for what's to come. In my mind I wanted to just get a raspberry pi and go crazy but after giving it some thought I think it would be more beneficial to start with an Arduino kit of sorts. After comparing a bunch of them, as well as soldering kits, I made up my cart and today, I bought it all. 

<br>

## The Learning Curve

<br>

This is all a fairly big investment, especially considering that coding in general has been fairly inexpensive for me money wise. Now that I'm getting in the realm of physical hardware I'm sure the financial dedication will be required. 

<br>

So what exactly did I get and why? I got an Arduino, a microcontroller that can control physical hardware with code. It's a bit of a step down in power from the raspberry pi but I think it's best for me to start with less strong tools. Speaking of the kit I got also comes with a breadboard. I would like to experiment with that as well as all the sensors that came in kit before I move onto the Arduino.

<br>

There are also other components like the Integrated Controllers or IC that offer a layer of abstraction for some lower level functions. But I think I'll allow myself to use them at least until I find my bearings with all this electronic stuff.

<br>

This is all new territory for me and I'm already having to fill knowledge gap on top of knowledge gap. I'm sure I'll understand this all better with time but nevertheless I'm super hyped for my package to arrive.
