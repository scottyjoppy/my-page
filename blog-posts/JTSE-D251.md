Hello friends,

<br>

The whole reason why I got this kit was that it was a car with wheels. Sick. But I still haven't gotten into all of that so today I actually pulled up the included online guide to setting everything up and just started.

<br>

## Makin A Car

<br>

It's a pretty helpful guide and really shows you step by step how to use all the individual motors and sensors. I will admit it's all very overwhelming at times, there's so many specific components ways to wire everything and I think it's a good first step to just follow the guide and start by making something. It's also my first shot at properly uploading code to the Arduino and doing more than just lighting an LED on and off.

<br>

There's a long road of learning ahead of me but I'm ready to start. Even if that is just with this kit car.
