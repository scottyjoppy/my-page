Hello,

<br>

Slow but steady progress on the Water Me project. I’ll go over what I did today, then write a bit about my plans after this project is complete.

<br>

## Progress

<br>

First things first I added an edit form. It wasn’t too complicated, I just modified the create form and changed supabases’ 'insert' method to 'update'. Then it was just a matter of fetching the current plants info and pre-filling the form. I also added a delete button to make it easier clean up while I’m working on this. I find it kind of funny to work on this without needing to login. I’m sure there are some security risk here since, as it is today, anyone who goes on the website can add plants and edit them. It’s probably good for me to add authentication soon so that my data isn’t changed by random strangers, I just found this funny.

<br>

## Post Water Me

<br>

It was always the plan to go more public with my projects and blog, I just wanted to be more comfortable and have actual content. Social media hasn’t ever really been top of mind for me, but I was hoping to at least make some daily posts promoting the blog. I've never really used X but I think that's a good place to start daily posting. One day I'd like to have more of a prescence and use my videography skills to put stuff online. For the time being though I know I need to work on my tech skills.

<br>

That's all I got for today, thank you for reading today's rather short blog. See ya tomorrow.
