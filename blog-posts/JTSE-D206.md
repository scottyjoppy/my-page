Hello friends,

<br>

Today I was forced to make a few quick updates as NextJS and React were heavily warning users to update since there were some vulnerabilities found. Now today isn't the first day that these were discovered but when I originally tried to just update everything I found that I kept getting this build error and couldn't be bothered to fix it. But today Vercel is actively preventing deployments if they detect these old versions, so I have to fix it. 

<br>

The updating process was relatively simple but the harder thing is dealing with this build error. It revolves around the blogs and some of the utilities I have built in to render them but the annoying part is having to update all this code that I know is redundant in the new version of the website. Needless to say my annoyed mind decided to just vibe code the entire solution, since I know once this website is updated, I'll be deleting all that anyways.

<br>

That was all for today, just saving the website from vulnerabilities, until the next breach, friends.
