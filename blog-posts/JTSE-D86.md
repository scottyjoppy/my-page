Hello friends,

<br>

Today I knew I wouldn't have much time to code so I instead prepared a loose plan of attack when it comes to implementing this email thing tomorrow. It ain't much but it's honest work.

<br>

## The Plan

<br>

There hardest thing to plan for is the unforeseeable issues that lie ahead. As much as I think I know about how I'm gonna do this I'm sure there will be things that come up that will stunt my progress. That being said, step one is to make the function. 

<br>

I'll have to find a way of looping through all the sites users, extracting their plants, comparing the dates to see if they need watering, and then create the email that will be sent out. I can already foresee that RLS will be an issue here as I'll need some way of adding a kind of admin client that can view everyone and everything. The part I'm not entirely sure of is how to use React Email. I'm aware of it's existence and a short video definitely showed me it's potential and why I should implement it here. I just don't know how it works as of now, but it's definitely on the list of things to learn to get this up and running. First and foremost, the function.

<br>

Once the function is done, yes, I can move onto the email portion. I gotta be careful here as the free plan I'm working off has a limit of 3000 emails a month, and 100 a day. Which is more than enough for a project like this, but I'm sure I could easily find a way to "accidentally" send myself thousands of emails. This would be super annoying, but it's nice to have that looming fear to push me to keep things clean and well made. So lots of debugging to make sure things are good before pushing.

<br>

From then on it's a matter of adding some database columns, changing up the profile page, cleaning up my routes, and sending this project off for it's version one drop. I'm excited to be done with this and to hopefully one day revisit it with some extended features. I had this wild idea of when I make my break into robotics to connect this app to some device that will water the plants for me but that's a project for the future.

<br>

Thank you for joining me today, may we each find solace in our darkest of times, and rejoice in the light of a thousand suns, farewell friends.
