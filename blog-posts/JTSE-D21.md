Hello,

<br>

I have many ideas for future projects. I have my recipe scraper on the back burner right now. I want to create a few draft websites to practice and populate the portfolio. But there are also a few just-for-fun ideas. Things that would just be cool but don't necessarily serve some purpose. Of course these still serve some purpose and would help me learn a new tech, but just isn't aligned with what I'm currently working on. My most recent idea came through a Hacker News post.

<br>

## [How to program a text adventure in C](https://helderman.github.io/htpataic/htpataic01.html)

<br>

I've been reading over this article on how this guy, Ruud Helderman, created a classic text-based adventure game. His tutorial type article outlines the process and architecture he takes up in creating this type of game. It's a very interesting read and has got me thinking, this would be a great project. Not just to create a text-based game, but one that could be educational.

<br>

## The idea

<br>

A text-based adventure game that teaches you how to use the command prompt. Every action in the game would be related to some command. I had the thought too that if the game had some time travel element to it, then I could tie in git commands. Additionally, there could be a search filter that involves using SQL commands. Sky's the limit, but execution is everything. It's an interesting idea and I'll definitely have to revisit it in the future. But I think this could be a great opportunity to learn and get comfortable with these commands in a fun interactive way. I was even thinking of the possibility of rendering cool ASCII art to go along with the game.  
But either way just a crazy idea I had today that will stay in my future projects' notes for now.

<br>

That's all I got for today, this has been a rather slow week in terms of commits, but it's wave; there will be lows but there will be highs too. It's important to just keep surfin'. See ya tomorrow.
