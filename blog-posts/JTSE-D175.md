Hello friends,

<br>

I have some new considerations with the project. After yesterday's semi-breakdown and foresight to the magnitude of this project, I realized I will be better off scaling the size of the project down, and creating something simpler and quicker. Because if I continue down this road and enact the full vision I have for this project, I will go way past my imaginary deadline. So today I will discuss the change in the projects direction.

<br>

## The New Plan

<br>

Before going over the new plan I'll recap what my original idea was. I wanted to create an isometric platformer with little checkpoints. You would jump higher and higher through a series of precisely timed jumps. 

<br>

The new plan however will go a little something like this. The player will stay on the ground floor and has the ability to jump and move in isometric space. Obstacles will fall from the sky and destroy the ground beneath the player, forcing them to avoid both the obstacles and the holes in the ground beneath. It's more of a dodge the bullet (obstacle) type game which is quite different from the platformer idea I originally had. This will dramatically simplify the physics as I will only have to consider the top of tiles and a lower variety of different building blocks. I can focus more on the level design, pacing, and I also have ambition to explore audio with this project.

<br>

I think this change will make things much more manageable and won't take nearly as long to finish as the original concept. I find it more useful to finish smaller simpler projects rather than learn everything for the first time on a huge one. I can come back to it in the future, wiser, and better equipped to write it in a timely manner.
