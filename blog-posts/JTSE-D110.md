Hello friends,

<br>

Today I made a few key decisions for my next endeavour in learning programming. I want to get back into C++, and I want to experiment with Vim.

<br>

## Vim

<br>

Up until now, I've written code solely using VS Code, the popular IDE which has held my hand through the very early stages of coding. I've really loved it and all it's features, even though I have yet to even scratch the surface of them all. I however have a few reasons why I think I should try a text based editor like Vim. For one, I think it's good as a programmer to not only be experienced in one form of writing code, I should practice writing good code everywhere, in VS Code, Vim, a notepad, even just on paper. My code shouldn't just be good because it's written in a specific place. I feel as if the abundance of autocomplete, prettier, and plugins, have distanced me from the importance of what I'm writing. As well as the importance of writing it well. I shouldn't always rely on my editor to for example, add a semi-colon to the end of my lines. I should understand one, why they're there, and two when to use them. Over-reliance on plugins like prettier I think too far remove me from that knowledge.

<br>

There's also a benefit in slowing things down. Really understanding the code one line at a time. And I think as I'm delving into a more backend focused project path, I want to feel closer to the metal per say, learn about the terminal, command prompts, and programming without a GUI. It can only benefit me as a programmer. Like I've heard online, no one ever "regrets" learning Vim, it may be hard, but it's worth the effort.

<br>

So that's my current journey, today I did some prep work to get things setup, and tomorrow I'll delve into testing things out proper. Thank you for reading today's blog, challenge yourself, life get's boring if it's always comfortable, friend.
