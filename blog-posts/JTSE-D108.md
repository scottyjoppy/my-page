Hello friends,

<br>

Today I made it so you can turn off notifications.

<br>

## Notifications

<br>

As the sole user of this app I can surely say that the notifications have been annoying me a bit. That's kind of the point to let you know when your plant needs watering, but while I'm still testing things it's just a bother. So I'm glad to say, I can turn them off now. In order to debug I just had to put in a few console logs and try catches to see if any errors were coming up. That's one part of vibe coding I like that LLM's remind me often to catch errors. I often forget and then when problems like this come up I have no idea what's going on. A few console logs later I found out I didn't have the right column name in the database. I fixed that and sicko, now I don't get emails.

<br>


Besides doing stuff for the project, I've also been looking at what I can do next. I know a very very basic amount of C but as I'm looking into making a game for my next project, C++ seems like the best choice. I think it's important to brush up on my lower level programming and honestly, I kinda liked C. I'm excited to use C++ more and expand my drawer of capabilities in that field.

<br>

Besides that I haven't had much time for anything else today, work has been pretty rough the past few days and the lack of sleep and exhausting days have been catching up to me. Soon enough however I'm gonna be taking some time off of work and will have more time to do other things. I'm excited for what's to come. Thank you for reading today's blog, consistency, is the hardest beast of them all, friend.
