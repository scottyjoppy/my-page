Hello friends,

<br>

I got motors now, fantastic, but how do I you know, use them.

<br>

## How To Make Spin

<br>

While I'm pretty confident everything is working. I lack the multimeter and bench supply to properly test and try out the motors, I do have a battery and some wires.

<br>

I spent a lot of today preparing before doing anything, to see how I could just make the motors spin without breaking something. The conclusion was that they should high enough rated volt wise that I should hopefully be able to just connect them to a battery and see. In the case that my 9V bat is too much I think just some light taps to see if it moves will be enough.

<br>

Two of the motors have some kind of circuit connected to it, I'm assuming to either encode, or just make the motor move electronically. But I'm not quite ready yet to unsolder it off. But that is definetly coming up next.

<br>

Otherwise I didn't do too much else. I haven't tried any of the boards or sensors yet but after some research I'm fairly certain that at least the main board will not run. This would likely be because production boards like these expect some kind of handshake with the rest of the printer to function. But since the rest of the printer is in the trash I don't think that will be possible. I digress.

<br>

Now I gotta move onto turning this motor into an actual servo!
