Hello,  
my name is Alexander Delisle and I will become a software engineer. I first ever touched code in September 2024. I was fascinated by such basic concepts as functions and loops and quickly challenged myself to create my first WebApp with **HTML** **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  
<br>

## The Idea

I've always had an interest in factory building games such as _[Factorio]()_ and _[Satisfactory]()_. At the time, I was into one - [Assembly Line 2](). Through previous experience in the genre I'm used to using online tools like material calculators to plan my factories as efficiently as possible. Since the community for this game is relatively small there were no such tools available so I decided to use my new found skills to create a calculator.

## Just Start

#### Better to start wrong than to not start at all.

This is not true in all cases. Like doing drugs. But nonetheless I find too easily was I overcome with choices. After hearing about a known state most beginner programmers find themselves in _Tutorial Hell_ I decided I should just start. So, armed with a few completed lessons on **_[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)_** and a excel sheet database I found on Reddit, I began.
<br>

## The Code

<br>

```javascript
function aiRobot(amountPS) {
  levelValue = machineLevelArr[8].value;
  levelCalc(levelValue);
  crafterMK3LVL = levelValueFound;
  machine[3].amount = amountPS / crafterMK3LVL;
  totalCrafterMK3 += machine[3].amount;

  aiRobotMade =
    cable(amountPS * 5, 4) +
    "<br>" +
    plate(amountPS * 10, 1) +
    "<br>" +
    aiRobotHead(amountPS) +
    "<br>" +
    aiRobotBody(amountPS) +
    " --> " +
    machine[3].amount +
    " " +
    machine[3].name +
    "~AI Robot";

  return aiRobotMade;
}
```

<br>

For as inefficient confusing and smelly my code was, boy did I have fun.  
I took a handful on concepts: functions, loops, if statements, and variables, and created something actually useful. I fell in love with coding with the endless void of learning in tech. As well as the abundance of sources to learn from online. I felt as if I've been blind to this world. I use the internet, I have a phone, a computer, but never did I think of how it all worked. I accepted that these things are beyond my understanding. But now, now a world of opportunity is ahead of me. And I'm excited to embark. To learn. To get better and better. That is the joy I felt after my first project. The hope I had. Which I'm happy to say is only stronger today.

## Going Forward
