Hello friends,

<br>

For starters yes I did a bit more work on the conversion of my player class to go from using screen coordinates to grid coordinates. I was unsuccessful, it's possible by some stroke of luck that I fell in the right direction, but definitely not far. So instead of focusing on that, I will talk NeoVim.

<br>

## NeoVim Gains

<br>

It's been almost two months that I've been using Vim and NeoVim as my main code editor. I've also in that time been primarily coding in C++. One main gain I've noticed is that I'm way quicker on a keyboard. Maybe not in pure words per second but when it comes to editing code I've leveled up for sure. Some tricks like the word search and replace with regex, fuzzy finding files, and selecting without a mouse, have sped things up quite a bit. While there are still edits that would be faster with a mouse, I think with time those would be surpassed.

<br>

Another gain is just better code, a better understanding of how my code works, where everything is and what it's doing. You feel closer to the metal, which feels like a good thing. Additionally, with the ability to create some custom commands I for example implemented a quick way to select and comment out a block of text. With shortcuts like this you can kinda simulate how things would be on say VS Code. On the topic, I do think there are some things I would wayyy rather do on VS Code.

<br>

## Where VSCode thrives

<br>

I a bit of React code in NVim and wanted to shoot myself. HTML is so not a fun language to write in and an extension like Emmet really makes it more palatable. I refuse to add similar autofill extensions to NVim since I think that defeats the purpose of using it in the first place, but I think it's wise to use the right program for the right job.

<br>

Despite being in VS Code, I do still have an extension that allows for Vim movements. Sometimes I just miss them haha. But for example as well, Markdown or simple Text files are not fun to write in NVim. To my understanding, long lines and Vim don't get along, it's much easier when things are vertically stacked rather than horizontally. So for your horizontal purposes, maybe avoid NVim, or get really good at it (the dream).

<br>

## Conclusion

<br>

So my thoughts on it for now, I'll continue to use NVim, and I'm very happy to do so. I think I've actually improved as a programmer and gained some valuable skills that are only available through knowledge of text editors. But I'll definitely be more considerate of the languages I'm programming in and my needs for autofill. Thank you for reading today's blog, and if you haven't tried Vim, try it, it's worth it.
