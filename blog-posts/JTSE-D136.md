Hello friends,

<br>

So I've been using NeoVim now for two days, here are my thoughts on it.

<br>

## Spoiler, It's Sick

<br>

I'm enjoying it a lot. I think just using remaps in general has improved my workflow a ton. Even now sometimes when I get in my flow coding is just so much more fun. To force myself to learn sometimes I disable my mouse to really force myself to navigate fully with my keyboard. Even switching through screens and tabs on my laptop.

<br>

Telescope is really nice, the fuzzy search has made it so much easier to find files. I'm starting to use fugitive a bit more as well, adding a few remaps to make committing my code quicker. I'm also trying to write somewhat better commit messages. I saw in today's video how he writes his commits, and he basically just checks all the modified files and writes what changed in each in bullet point format. I'll try doing that from now on.

<br>

Overall NeoVim has been a great switch. I do really recommend starting out with just Vim long enough to get used to the Vim navigation, but after that, NeoVim is a perfectly good way to go. The abundance of community development alone is enough reason for me to switch here. Things are going well, until next time, friend.
