Hello,

<br>

Today was all about design. Feels like I’ve just been in design mode for the past few days, and although I feel bad for not coding, it is nice to get some of this stuff done. So instead of talking about making new buildings again, I’ll talk of some other interests and plans for the future. 

<br>

## Robots

<br>

Robots are one of the main reasons I want to be in tech. I’m a firm believer that I’ll see amazing developments in the field of robotics and AI in my lifetime, and I want to be right in there when it happens. While my passion does reside in music, I believe robots are the key to automating mundane tasks, in order to allow humans to pursue creative endeavours. Robots can and should be doing a lot for us. While they already do if you consider a microwave or laundry machine, I’m thinking more in terms of androids. There are many economical implications when we consider androids replacing humans in most jobs, but I’ll focus on my excitement for robotics. 

<br>

## Mechanical Engineering

<br>

If I ever went back to study I think I would study either mechanical engineering or AI. I unfortunately didn’t think to take physics in high school even though I like math, but I believe structured study on the topic would outplay my self-teaching abilities using the web. Once I get a chance I do want to start experimenting with arduinos, raspberry pi’s, and building things that move. One day I’ll just automate everything around the house. Exciting.

<br>

Back to the design, it’s starting to shape up quite well. I’m putting some forethought into where I’ll be adding my dynamic components, and how my animations will play out. I think the concept of having cars driving around could be cool but that leaves the issue of how to rotate an isometric object since they’re not inherently 3D. I have a few ideas on that front but we’ll face those at a later date. Thanks for reading today’s blog, I’ll see ya tomorrow.
