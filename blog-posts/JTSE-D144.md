Hello friends,

<br>

So it's been a few days. For the past few days I've been starting a new job and haven't had much time or energy to focus on code. I've been slacking simply put. In addition, what I'm trying to learn now requires a lot of brain power and I want to give it the necessary space to understand. That thing is Verlet Integration.

<br>

## What?

<br>

While I'm in no position or state to give an explanation of Verlet, what it generally is- is a method used to find out the next position of an object by using it's current/previous positions, and acceleration. It's widely used in game development and allows you to integrate different forces when affecting an object.

<br>

Like I said in the intro I want to give myself enough space to fully understand how this function works. How acceleration, velocity, collision, and general game physics are implemented. But I am honest, I do need to pull myself out of the water since sometimes I fall into a hole of wanting to understand physics too much and it becomes to far disconnected from what I started with. But all I want to update y'all with this blog is that yes, I'm alive and well, learning about physics and excited to create some physics simulations.

<br>

Thank you for reading today's blog, I hope to come out with better explanations on this all soon. Until next time.
