Hello friends,

<br>

Today I spent the day modifying files to get things up and running. I'll keep today's blog to a more update-like post.

## Today's Progress

<br>

So I spent most of the day just reviewing the project so far. Understanding how files interplay and determining what was and wasn't necessary. For example I made it so the character can only move left and right, as well as shooting to be as simple as clicking or pressing the L key. The simple shooting change made all the logic with mouse position redundant. Now instead of having to calculate the position of the mouse every time I just had to detect a mouse click. Additionally, instead of determining the direction of the bullet, the bullet now just has to travel in one direction, up.

<br>

I also swapped out some texture to more Space Invaders-esque sprites.

<br>

All in all things are starting out well. It's really nice to get to code without having to pull up the tutorial every three seconds. Thank you for reading today's blog and I'll see y'all tomorrow.
