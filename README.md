# Alexander Delisle – Portfolio

Hi, my name is **Alexander Delisle**. I'm a 24-year-old software engineer-in-training, originally from Canada and now based in Vienna, Austria. In 2024, I made the decision to transition into tech and have since been immersing myself in the fundamentals of **programming**, **web development**, **security**, and **data storage**.

This portfolio serves as a central hub for documenting my journey, sharing my projects, and connecting with like-minded individuals.
